# Eco Monthly Value Report

Once Eco for AWS has been enabled for your organization and you have chosen your commitment [Strategy](eco/tutorials/choose-a-strategy), all users associated with the organization will begin to receive automated, monthly emails to help you understand the value Eco provides. Our goal is to save you both time and money. The email explains how and is described below.

### Subject Line - Eco Total Savings

The subject line contains the name of your company as it appears in the Spot console. Additionally, it will show the total savings Eco provided for the month previous to the mailing.

### Report Header

The header restates the goal and provides the date of the report.
