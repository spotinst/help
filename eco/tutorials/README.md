# Eco Tutorials

Eco actively manages the full lifecycle of your commitments, including planning, purchasing, and reselling. It ensures that your reserved instance and Savings Plan portfolio is optimized from the start, starting with your existing commitment purchases and creating a well-balanced mix of reserved instances and Savings Plans that continues to adapt to changing needs and usage.

## How it Works

Eco takes you through the three-step process described below.

### Step 1: Analyze

Eco combines years of analysis of detailed marketplace and industry usage data with the complete details of your cloud purchases and usage by region, instance family, tags, lifespan, and scale. That analysis is used to provide a holistic view of on-demand use across all of your linked AWS accounts.

### Step 2: Plan

Eco uses those analytics to determine optimal purchasing strategies tailored to your cloud usage, evaluating your existing reserved instance and Savings Plans portfolio together with any number of commitment purchase options to keep commitment terms low and utilization high. You save the highest amount possible while retaining the most flexibility for the future.

### Step 3: Act

Based on those analytics and strategies, Eco helps you to build and manage your portfolio of committed capacity purchases. Constantly tweaking strategies based on market availability and new data, Eco continuously buys, sells, and manages your portfolio to maximize savings with an optimal mix of reserved instances and Savings Plans.
