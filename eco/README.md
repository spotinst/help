# Eco

Eco is a service that helps you manage your cloud commitments for the major cloud providers. This can include reserved instances, savings plans, and committed use discounts (CUDs).

Depending on your plan, you can save between 30% and 60% with these commitments. However, many businesses either miss out on these savings or do not achieve their full potential.

Managing changes and predicting how much you will use can be difficult and time-consuming for most companies. Organizations often struggle to match their spending on commitments with what their engineering teams need. A solution that allows DevOps teams to handle infrastructure while helping finance leaders control costs is ideal.

Eco uses automation, analytics, forecasting models, and human oversight to help you create the best savings strategy and choose the right commitments for your needs. Eco tracks your usage in realtime to find any drops in usage, so you can adjust or offload instances as needed.

Eco helps you get the most value from your cloud commitments by offering:

* A fully-managed commitment portfolio
* Less commitment lock-in
* FinOps collaboration
* No extra work for your engineering team
