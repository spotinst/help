## Connect to Machine

Within the Spot PC console there is a "Quick Action" for each machine to remotely connect to that machine. Clicking the link will connect you directly to that machine and authenticate you as a local admin.

## Traceroutes

If the end users' experience is impacted by network performance, running a traceroute from their local device to _rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com_. This will highlight any network latency issues on the local network and the ISP connection back to the Azure network backbone. The 3rd party utility [PingPlotter](https://www.pingplotter.com/download) is a good utility this test.
