Click on the links below to learn about the major features.

### Central Security Dashboard

The [dashboard](spot-security/features/security-dashboard/) is a central point of reference into the security of your cloud environment and enables quick remediations for the risks discovered.

### Risk Analysis

Spot Security’s [Risk Analysis](spot-security/features/analyze-risks/) shows you the security risks discovered in your cloud environment with visibility at a high level and at a very detailed-level view. Spot Security then takes the next step of showing you the appropriate remediations you can act on.

### Filters

You can filter the findings based on a limitless number of different cloud accounts, regions and asset types. Risks are classified as high, medium or low in order to give you a prioritized view of them.

You can also have a broader view of the number of affected resources. This broader view of the individual risk enables you to see risk maps for each risk and see the attacked surface.

### Preset View

Spot Security’s Preset View saves filters that have been selected in the main dashboard in the past. All analytics and recommendations change according to the preset.

### Topology View

[Topology](spot-security/features/topology) provides comprehensive views with service maps that illustrate the relationships between cloud assets that affect each other.

### Visibility by Events

The [Events](spot-security/features/events) page provides insights into your cloud environment by showing a historical listing of all events that occured. Statistics are provided to help you see the big picture, and details about each event are available.

### Resource Inventory

The Asset [Inventory](spot-security/features/inventory) provides a list of all assets detected within your cloud network (per scan at a specific time) that enables you to see your cloud environment from another important perspective.

### Compliance

Spot Security provides information on how compliant each asset is with global security standards.
