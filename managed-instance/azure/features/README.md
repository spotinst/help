# Stateful Node for Azure Features

Stateful Node is tailored to the single node use case and is the ideal way to optimize cost by leveraging cloud excess capacity while mitigating the risks of running on spot nodes.

Stateful Node provides recovery and flexibility by enabling customers to leverage Spot algorithms and expansive statistical database. This ensures workloads are launched in the best possible Spot market for pricing and availability while gaining granular control with detailed dashboards and monitoring tools.

Stateful Node provides quick access to lossless state maintenance on Spot, with root, data volume, and network persistence. This is ideal for use cases such as monolithic applications, dev/test machines, or database workloads.

Stateful Node also supports scheduling actions and provides continuous backup options to enable cross-AZ and cross-Region resilience and recovery.
