## Example Use Cases

Customers who manage their workloads based on IP addresses.
Migrating existing services without having to change the configurations.
NoSQL databases (e.g., Cassandra, Scylla, Mongo) that require a fixed set of Private IPs.

## Persist Network for Stateful Node
In the Elastigroup Stateful Node, the Persist Network feature maintains the same Private IP and Public IP addresses for the node during VM replacements.
