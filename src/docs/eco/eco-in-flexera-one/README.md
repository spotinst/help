## Eco in Flexera One

Eco is a service that helps you manage reserved capacity for your cloud resources. It makes it easy to plan, buy, and sell reserved instances.
 
You get good savings using reserved instances (RIs) and savings plans (SPs), depending on your commitment. However, many businesses either miss these savings or don't save as much as they could. Managing changes and predicting long-term use can be tough and time-consuming. Companies often struggle to match their spending with actual engineering needs. That's why it's important to have a solution that helps DevOps teams manage infrastructure, while allowing finance leaders to control costs.
 
Eco uses advanced analytics and forecasting to buy the best mix of commitments for you. It tracks your reserved instance and savings plan usage in real time. So if your usage decreases, Eco can sell back unused instances to the marketplace.
 
With Eco, you can maximize your cloud spending by:
* **Fully using commitments**. Get the most return on your cloud commitment purchases. Eco analyzes, modifies, and maps unused reserved instances and savings plans to resource demands.
* **Managing commitment lifecycles**. Automated buying strategies for reserved instances make sure your workloads run at the best prices throughout their lifecycle.
* **Bringing finance and DevOps together**. Help finance and DevOps teams work together by giving them clear insights into usage and automating the best purchasing strategies for reserved instances and savings plans.
