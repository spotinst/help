# Eco Overview

Eco is a flexible reserved capacity management service that allows AWS users to plan, buy, and sell reserved instances effortlessly.

Reserved Instances (RIs) offer 30-60% discounts depending on your commitment plan, yet many businesses either forgo the benefit or achieve a savings rate well below the potential. In addition, managing the on-going changes and predicting long-term use is challenging and time consuming for most enterprises. Organizations quickly find that matching commitment spend to engineering demands is extremely challenging. A solution that allows DevOps to manage infrastructure and enables Finance leaders to control cost is the best possible solution.

Using deep analytics, forecasting models, and the Reserved Instance Marketplace, Eco will automatically purchase the optimal fleet of RIs for you. Eco uses real-time tracking of RI utilization to identify any decrease in usage so that instances can be sold back to the Marketplace if needed.
