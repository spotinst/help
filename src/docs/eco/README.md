# Eco

Eco is a flexible reserved capacity management service that manages cloud commitments (Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and CUDs) on behalf of the customers of the major cloud providers. 

Savings commitments offer 30-60% discounts depending on your plan, yet many businesses either forgo the benefit or achieve a savings rate well below the potential. In addition, managing the on-going changes and predicting long-term use is challenging and time consuming for most enterprises. Organizations quickly find that matching commitment spend to engineering demands is extremely challenging. A solution that allows DevOps to manage infrastructure and enables Finance leaders to control cost is the best possible solution. 

Using automation, deep analytics, forecasting models, and human oversight, Eco will help you define your optimal savings strategy and purchase the optimal fleet of commitments for you. Eco uses real-time utilization tracking to identify any decrease in usage so that instances can be offloaded or adjusted as needed. 

Eco enables you to get the most out of cloud commitment purchases. This includes: 

* A full managed commitment portfolio 
* Reduced commitment lock-in 
* FinOps synergy 
* No Engineering Effort
