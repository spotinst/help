# View your Savings

Once Eco Azure has been enabled for your organization and you have chosen your reservation and savings plan strategy, your Eco Azure dashboard will display a more complete view of savings.

To view the Eco Azure dashboard in the console, go to Eco on the left menu and click Dashboard.

## Filters

The default view of the Eco Azure dashboard shows data from all the subscriptions in your Azure Tenant.

During the first setup of the Eco Azure dashboard, data from the past 90 days is loaded and then updated daily going forward.

By default, the dashboard shows all loaded data from Azure that Eco Azure has available. However, you can use the drop-down filters to limit the scope of data displayed.

You can set the following filters:

- Time: Choose the range of dates for which data will be displayed for the chart and tables.
- Regions: Choose the regions which will be included in the chart and tables.
- Services: Choose the services which will be included in the charts and tables.

## Summary Line

The Overview dashboard includes a summary line that displays the following information:

- Current Monthly Commitment: The dollar amount of monthly commitment for reserved instance coverage.
- Current Monthly Waste: The dollar amount of monthly waste for reserved instance coverage.

## Graphs and Charts

Eco Azure provides summary graphs and charts to give you wide visibility of your savings and commitments. The graphs and charts can be filtered according to the items in the legend. The following graphs are displayed:

### Savings over Time

<img src="/eco/_media/azure-view-your-savings-1.png" />

* Subscription ID: Subscription number identifier.
* Commitment ID: Identifier of the Reservation or Savings Plan. The row and ID appear when it fits within the relevant filters.
* Commitment Type: Reservation, Savings Plan
* Source: Eco or Non-Eco
* Equivalent OD Price: What the on-demand price would have been during that time period.
* Generated Savings: How much you saved due to using commitments' discounted rates instead of the full on-demand rates. Calculation: On-demand equivalent minus commitments minus uncovered spend. Not necessarily the same as net savings.
* $ Used: The total equivalent cost within the time range multiplied by the utilization.
  - Example 1: If the time range covered the entire term of the reservation, it was 100% utilized, and the total equivalent cost was $1000, the result would be $1000.
  - Example 2: If the time range was half the history of the same reservation, it would be $500.
  - Example 3: If it was only 50% utilized during that period, it would be $250.
  - Example 4: If the term of the RI is three years and only one year of the period has passed since it was purchased, it would be possible to show only 33.3% of the total equivalent cost in this field, at maximum.
* % Used: Utilization within that time period.
