### Step 5. Read Only Access to Enterprise Enrollment Data

**If you do not have access to the EA portal, please follow the instructions in the Azure guide to [add the Enrollment Reader Access in the Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/direct-ea-administration#add-another-enterprise-administrator)**.

1. Log into https://ea.azure.com/.
2. In the left Navigation, click Manage.
3. Within the Enrollment tab, copy the Enrollment Number and set that aside for now.

4. Ensure the Auth Level on the Enrollment Detail says “Work or School Account Cross tenant”. It is possible to temporarily set it as this auth level. Just switch it to “Work or School Account Cross tenant,” send the invite, then switch it back to your preferred Auth Level.
