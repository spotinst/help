# Connect your AWS Account

## Prerequisite

Getting started with Eco on AWS usually requires read-only permissions to the Cost and Usage Reports, which are located in the Management account, or in specially configured [member accounts](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/cost-and-usage-report-now-available-to-member-linked-accounts/). Choose one of the following methods:

- Read data from your Direct-to-AWS Management Account and connect as described below.
- Read data from a single AWS MSP/Reseller customer account and connect as described below.
- Read data for multiple AWS MSP/Reseller customer accounts, connect as described below, and follow the [MSP enrollment process](design-documents/msp/msp-enrollment).
- Read data for limited AWS MSP/Reseller customer accounts and connect as described in [Connect Account: Customer Working with MSP](eco/getting-started/connect-account-customer-working-with-msp).

## AWS Region

All actions in this procedure should be made in the US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) AWS region. This includes generating the CUR file into a bucket in us-east-1. If there is a problem doing this, please contact Support.

## Get Started

Once you log into the Spot Console, go to the Eco dashboard. You will see the following message:

<img src="/eco/_media/gettingstarted-aws-connect-01.png" width="300" height="212" />

Click Add Permissions to start the connection wizard.

<img src="/eco/_media/gettingstarted-aws-connect-02.png" />

From here, follow the steps on screen to connect your account.

## Step 1

Log in to your AWS management account (or single, member account if you are an MSP end customer).

## Step 2

Set up Cost and Usage Reports as described below. 

1. Log in to [AWS](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/home#/bcm-data-exports) and click **AWS Billing and Cost Management Data Exports**. 
2. To create a new export, click **Create**. 

![connect-aws-1](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/106514736/da4aad90-3fa9-44e2-bd20-f4b2a2170cc4)

3. Select **Legacy CUR export**. 

![connect-aws-2](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/106514736/42dd96b1-eac1-4a16-b8ec-7663191c26aa)

4. Enter a name for your CUR export. 
5. Complete the following information to export the configuration:  

![connect-aws-3](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/106514736/726141b4-388f-4ffd-870b-cd9e790eacf1)

* Underâ€¯Additional export details, mark **Include Resource IDs**.  
* Under Data refresh settings, mark **Refresh automatically**.  

![connect-aws-4](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/106514736/5b10c71c-fba4-4ca3-9d50-770dbde3ee8d)

* Mark Report data time granularity units to **Hourly**. 
* Mark Report versioning to **Overwrite existing report**. 
* Mark Report data integration for **Amazon Athena**. 

![connect-aws-5](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/106514736/799b3862-0bf9-43c9-83a1-20f9ac633047)

6. If you have not previously set up a new Amazon S3 bucket for the CUR, click **Configure** under Data export storage settings. 
7. A S3 path prefix is required to create the report.  
8. Click **Create**.
 
> **Note**: Spot strongly recommends that you create both a new Amazon S3 bucket and a new Cost and Usage Reports if you do not have Athena already integrated. If you choose to use a pre-existing S3 bucket, the following Athena integration setup process using AWS CloudFormation removes any Amazon S3 events that your bucket might already have.

## Step 3

1. In your AWS account, go to the Cost and Usage Reports page.
2. Under Delivery Options, copy the S3 Bucket value.

3. Return to your account in the Spot Console and paste the name of the S3 bucket where the hourly cost and usage reports are stored.

## Step 4

Open the linked Cloudformation Template.

<img src="/eco/_media/gettingstarted-aws-connect-06.png" />

## Step 5

Mark the checkbox acknowledging that CloudFormation will create IAM resources, and hit create.

<img src="/eco/_media/gettingstarted-aws-connect-07.png" />

## Step 6

Once the stack is created, copy the Spot Role ARN from the CloudFormation stack Outputs tab.

Once your Organization is connected to Eco, initial data processing will take up to 48 hours. You will be notified via email when your dashboards are ready.

## Step 7 (optional)

Eco has the ability to process historical AWS Cost and Usage Report files in the CSV format. If you have previous CUR files in the CSV format that you would like to add, please place them into the S3 bucket with the current CUR files being generated from the setup.
