# Connect your AWS Account

## Prerequisite

Getting started with Eco on AWS requires read-only permissions to the Cost and Usage Reports, which are located in the Master Payer account.

## AWS Region

All actions in this procedure should be made in the US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) AWS region. (This includes generating the CUR file into a bucket in us-east-1.) If there is a problem doing this, please contact Support.

## Get Started

Once you log into the Spot Console, go to the Eco dashboard. You will see the following message:

Click Add Permissions to start the connection wizard.

From here, follow the steps on screen to connect your account.

## Step 1

Log in to your AWS Master Payer account.

## Step 2

Set up Cost and Usage Reports.

**Important**:

- If your account is not managed by an MSP, complete Step 2 and continue with the setup.
- If your Account is managed by an MSP, your MSP must set up the Cost and Usage reports as described [here](eco/getting-started/connect-account-customer-working-with-msp). Skip Steps 2 and 3 and continue with Step 4.
