# Connect Your Azure Account for Eco Analysis

This document describes the requirements for Spot Eco to provide an estimated cost savings analysis. The procedure below describes the connection process. If you want a more detailed explanation of Spot's roles and permissions, please review our [access roles and permissions page](eco/azure-tutorials/access-roles-read-only). 

The steps below apply to the following account/agreement types:

* EA
* MCA
* MOSP/PAYG

**Note**: CSP users- please contact https://spot.io/contact/ for connection details.

## Prerequisites

- Review [read-only permissions](eco/azure-tutorials/access-roles-read-only) required for Eco Cost Specialist team.
- The Azure user performing these steps must be a Global Administrator with [elevated access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin#elevate-access-for-a-global-administrator) and access to the relevant Management Group(s) or Subscription(s).
- The Azure user performing this step must be an Enterprise Administrator (EA) or Billing account owner (MCA).
- A Member Account only. The account cannot be a guest user account.
- A registered Spot account.

## Connect Cloud Account 

Complete the following steps: 

1. In the left main menu, click **Eco** and select **Microsoft Azure** as your cloud provider. 
2. Select **Azure Billing Account**. 
3. Select [Automated Onboarding](eco/getting-started/connect-azure-account?id=connect-automatically) or [Manual Onboarding](eco/getting-started/connect-azure-account?id=connect-manually). 

### Connect Automatically 

1. Connecting automatically is the quicker option. The Microsoft Application Consent process allows Eco Azure to build the app registration on your behalf and use your credentials.

### Connect Manually 
While the automated process is much easier and preferred by most, the manual process allows for adherence to higher security requirements when needed.

#### Assign the Enrollment Reader
