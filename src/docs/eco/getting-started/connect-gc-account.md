# Connect Your GC Organization 

Prior to enabling Eco to achieve cost reductions in Google Cloud, it is advisable to have Spot analyze your organization and provide an estimate of the savings Eco can provide. To connect Eco to your GCP account using read only access to cost, usage and bill data, please contact your sales representative.  If you do not currently have a sales representative or are unsure of their contact information, please reach out to us through https://spot.io/contact/ .
