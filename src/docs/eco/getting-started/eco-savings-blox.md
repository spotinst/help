# Eco Savings Blox

Eco Savings Blox is a method of providing qualified customers with deep, targeted savings. To obtain the savings, a customer commits to a per-region, on-demand equivalent for which Eco guarantees reasonable coverage.

## Prerequisites
- Connect to Cloud Analyzer.
- Eco Savings Blox is currently available only to [AWS in India (“AISPL”)](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/what-is-aispl/) customers.
- Engage with your Spot representative to review your usage and provide a proposal.
- Accept the proposal for your on-demand equivalent commitment and the coverage we can provide.

## About the Proposal

The proposal is an essential component of the Blox agreement.

With or without Blox, Eco continues to manage all savings. Using Blox, Eco guarantees coverage for an agreed-upon Blox on-demand equivalent. If Eco’s coverage dips below the Blox threshold, Eco will reimburse customers for the commitments used to cover the targeted region.

If the customer usage dips below the Blox on-demand equivalent, Eco will do everything possible to reduce waste on the customer’s behalf.

At the present time, there is no Eco dashboard component related to the Blox offering.
