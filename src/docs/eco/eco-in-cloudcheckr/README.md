# Eco in CloudCheckr

CloudCheckr is an end-to-end cloud management platform to control cost, ensure security, optimize resources, and enable services.

Eco is a flexible reserved capacity management service that allows AWS users to plan, buy, and sell reserved instances effortlessly, and it is offered on CloudCheckr as well as on Spot.

Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans (SPs) offer 30-60% discounts depending on your commitment plan, yet many businesses either forgo the benefit or achieve a savings rate well below the potential. In addition, managing the on-going changes and predicting long-term use is challenging and time consuming for most enterprises. Organizations quickly find that matching commitment spend to engineering demands is extremely challenging. A solution that allows DevOps to manage infrastructure and enables Finance leaders to control cost is the best possible solution.

Using deep analytics, forecasting models, and the Reserved Instance Marketplace, Eco automatically purchases the optimal portfolio of commitments for you. Eco uses real-time tracking of RI and SP utilization to identify any decrease in usage so that instances can be sold back to the Marketplace if needed.

Eco enables you to get the most out of cloud commitment purchases. This includes:
- Fully utilizing commitments: Ensuring maximum ROI on cloud commitment purchases with analysis, modification, and mapping of unused RIs and SPs to resource demands.
- Managing commitment lifecycles: Automated purchasing strategies for RIs in the AWS Marketplace throughout their lifecycle to ensure workloads are always running at optimal pricing.
- Aligning Finance and DevOps: Enabling collaboration between Finance and DevOps teams with full visibility into compute consumption and automation of optimal RI and SP strategies.
