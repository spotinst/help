# Set Subset and Workflow Permissions

If you would like to be an administrator of [Subsets](eco/tutorials/manage-subsets) and [Workflows](eco/tutorials/manage-workflows), you can do so under the following types of permissions.
- Organizational Admins. By default Organizational Admins are administrators over all of Spot.
- Account Viewer. By default this permission does not have the ability to create or edit Subsets and Workflows, but by using the procedure described below, you can grant the Account Viewer the additional permissions needed to be an administrator of Subsets and Workflow.

## Prerequisites
- You must be an Organizational Admin to create a new Policy.
- You have a user with Account Viewer permissions who wants to be an Admin for Subsets and Workflows.
