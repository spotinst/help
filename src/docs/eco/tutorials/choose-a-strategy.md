You can choose a strategy that best suits your needs:

- Short Term
- Medium Term
- Long Term
- Custom Term

When you mark a strategy, be sure to check the information to the right which includes summary line and potential yearly savings for the selected strategy.

## Summary Line

The Summary Line displays the following numbers:

- All Time Waste: Amount wasted on unused reserved instances.
- Current RI Commitment: The monthly amount of reserved instance compute capacity you are currently committed to.
- Recommended RI Commitment: The monthly amount recommended for your workload following the Eco analysis.
