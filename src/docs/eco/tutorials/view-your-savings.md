# View Savings in Dashboard

Once Eco has been enabled for your organization and you have chosen your reserved instance (RI) [Strategy](eco/tutorials/choose-a-strategy), your Eco dashboard (AWS) will switch to a more complete view of savings.

To view the Eco dashboard in the console, go to Eco on the left side and click Dashboard, then click the AWS tab.

## Filters

The default view of the dashboard shows data from all the accounts in your organization.

By default, the dashboard shows data since the first day of your AWS account, from all regions, and from all of your AWS services. However, you can use the drop-down filters to limit the scope of data displayed. For example, you can display according to services such as EC2, RDS, and ElastiCache.

You can set the following filters:

- **Time**: Choose the range of dates for which data will be displayed.
- **Regions**: Choose the regions which will be included in the charts and tables.
- **Services**: Choose the services which will be included in the charts and tables.

## Summary Line

The Overview dashboard includes a summary line which displays the following information:
- Total Saved: Total amount saved as a result of reserved instance and savings plan coverage.
- Current Commitment: The amount currently committed to reserved instances. The lower the commitment, the more flexible and dynamic the account's compute resources can be.
- MTD Savings: Total generated savings from day one of the month to the most recent update.

## Graphs and Charts

Eco provides summary graphs and charts to give you wide visibility of your savings and commitments. The graphs and charts can be filtered according to the items in the legend. The following graphs are displayed:

### Savings Over Time

A bar graph shows the amount of savings each month broken down by type of savings. This graph will allow you to visualize savings from reservations and savings plans. You can use the filters at the top of the page and source filters specific to each graph.

- All: This source filter displays all savings provided by Eco, Non-Eco and Support Savings.
- Eco: This source filter displays all savings provide by Eco.
- Non-Eco: This source filter displays all savings provided by the customer.
- Support Savings: This source filter displays all savings Eco saved you on AWS Support Plans. AWS provides different Support Tiers and charges differently for each tier. We retrieve and calculate how much a customer would be spending on support if they werenâ€™t using Eco. Eco does not charge customers based on these savings.
- Savings Data vs. Billing Data: The savings data displayed is the total saved by Eco and Non-Eco services from AWS data. This data may differ from the billing data presented in the Spot console retrieved from AWS on the 5th of every month. For further insights into the calculation of fees, please refer to the following documentation: [Fee Calculation Details](connect-your-cloud-provider/dashboard?id=fee-calculation).

It is important to note that RI Volume Discounts may appear in Savings Over Time because they also drive the cost of reservations down. Eco includes these cost reductions in our net savings calculations.

### Monthly Commitment Over Time

A stacked bar graph showing your reserved instance and savings plan commitment per month broken down into Standard, Convertible, and Pending reservations, plus Compute and EC2 savings plans. Use the toggle switches to include or exclude recurring fees or show up-front fees from an amortized view. Regardless of what data range you select in the date filter, this graph will remain static, looking six months into the past and thirty-six months into the future.

The export from this table provides an amortization report, which breaks down each commitment as a CSV file with the following information.

- Amortized Commitment: The amortized amount for the month. If there was no upfront commitment, this will be zero.
- ARN: The AWS Resource Name unique to the commitment.
- Date: The year and month of the amortized amount.
- Duration: The number of seconds used in the calculation for which the investment should provide discounts with consideration for RI marketplace transactions.
- Expiration: The expiration date of the commitment.
- Instance Family or Type: The instance family of the reservation or type of the savings plan.
- Region: The region in which the commitment was purchased.
- Upfront Commitment: The basis for the amortized commitment. If there was no upfront commitment, this will be zero.
- Recurring Commitment: The monthly commitment charge.  
- Total Commitment: Total commitment spend.

### Coverage Over Time

A line graph that breaks down the story of how reservations, savings plan coverage, and commitments relate to your overall savings. The left chart is the simplest, showing the difference between your actual spend and what could have been your costs for reservable services without a savings strategy. On the right, you see the same data, but with your actual spend explained as the combination of commitment cost and uncovered spend. The coverage calculation considers dollars or your investment used instead of hours, which is different from AWS Cost Explorer. For actual spend, the calculation only considers what is reservable for a service (e.g., Eco only uses the on-demand purchase option, with the Running Hours usage type groups and the Usage charge type). You can use the source filter specific to the Coverage Over Time graph.  

* All  
* Eco  
* Non-Eco

### Commitment Usage Distribution Over Time

A filterable table and corresponding chart which allow you to review your commitments in a variety of ways. By placing your cursor in the filter field, you will see which parameters can be selected.

<img src="/eco/_media/view-savings-commitment_usage_distro_overtime.png" />

- **Account ID**: Account number identifier.
- **Commitment ID**: Identifier of the Reservation or Savings Plan. The row and ID appear when it fits within the relevant filters.
- **Commitment Type**: Standard RI, Convertible RI, Compute Savings Plan, or EC2 Savings Plan.
- **$ Used**: The total equivalent cost within the time range multiplied by the utilization.
  - **Example 1**: If the time range covered the entire term of the reservation, it was 100% utilized, and the total equivalent cost was $1000, the result would be $1000.
  - **Example 2**: If the time range was half the history of the same reservation, it would be $500.
  - **Example 3**: If it was only 50% utilized during that period, it would be $250.
  - **Example 4**: If the term of the RI is three years and only one year of the period has passed since it was purchased, it would be possible to show only 33.3% of the total equivalent cost in this field, at maximum.
- **% Used**: Utilization within that time period.
- **Equivalent OD Price**: What the on-demand price would have been during that time period.
- **Generated Savings**: How much you saved due to using commitments' discounted rates instead of the full on demand rates. Calculation: On Demand equivalent minus commitments minus uncovered spend. Not necessarily the same as net savings.
- **Source**: Eco or Non-Eco.

### Total Active Commitments

This chart provides amortized costs (i.e., up-front plus recurring costs) of all active commitments according to the designated filters and views.

## Commitment Details Report

Below the overview graphs and pie charts, you can view detailed information about your reserved instances, including your total generated savings at the bottom of the table.

<img src="/eco/_media/view-savings-commitment_details.png" />

When a reservation expires, Eco first makes sure a renewal is the right course of action. If so, expired coverage will be replaced with the best commitment to provide a blend of flexibility and savings. When an expiration is renewed a new lease ID will be created. Depending on the situation, an expired reservation may be renewed under different parameters, so do not be concerned if you do not see an exact match.

### Filter Data

You can filter the data displayed according to several criteria available.

1. Place your cursor in the filter and click a parameter.
