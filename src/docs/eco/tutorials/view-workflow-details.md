# View Workflow Details

For each [Workflow](eco/tutorials/manage-workflows) you create, you can view a summary of the rules included, generate a workflow report, and access information about reports created in the past.

To get to the Workflow Details page, do the following:

1. In the left sidebar of the console, click Reports.
2. Click the Workflows tab, and click the name of a workflow.

TotalSavings, RISavingsOnly, Eco RI Savings, SPSavingsOnly, and Eco SP Savings are great ways to see your commitments’ effectiveness. Here are some important notes about Savings:

- Net savings is the difference between discounted cost and on-demand equivalents, plus portioned, effective cost of the commitments themselves.
- The sum of savings associated with accounts not included in the report will appear as a row with the AccountID as 'Other'.
- Most reports will not show Savings within the Master Payer unless a billing rule requests the Master Payer to appear (for instance, when the Master Payer recoups the cost of commitments as a result of the Cross-Account Cost Sharing rules).
