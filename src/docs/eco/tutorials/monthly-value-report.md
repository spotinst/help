# Eco Monthly Value Report

Once Eco for AWS has been enabled for your organization and you have chosen your commitment [Strategy](eco/tutorials/choose-a-strategy), all users associated with the organization will begin to receive automated, monthly emails to help you understand the value Eco provides. Our goal is to save you both time and money. The email explains how and is described below.

### Subject Line - Eco Total Savings

The subject line contains the name of your company as it appears in the Spot console. Additionally, it will show the total savings Eco provided for the month previous to the mailing.

### Report Header

The header restates the goal and provides the date of the report.

### Resources Covered by Eco

### Savings Over Time

### Top Expiring RIs Eco is Reviewing

A list of the IDs of up to five RIs with impending expiration dates and savings they provide. Eco has been analyzing these to determine whether to renew them and, if so, what the best opportunities for savings are.

### Eco Checklist

A reminder of some of the actions performed on your behalf over this past month. There are others, but they are not detailed as a part of our proprietary logic.

### Note from a Cost Specialist

If a cost specialist wants to deliver you a personalized message, it will appear below the Checklist.

### Contact Button

If you have any questions or want to let us know of upcoming account changes, please contact your assigned cost specialist. The button allows you to send an email directly to our Eco support queue for review.

### Receiving Emails

If you are interested in being added to the list of customers receiving the email, ensure that you are listed as a user within your desired organization and submit a support ticket.

For companies which have been added to the allow-list, Eco sends the email to the email addresses of users registered with your organization in the Spot platform.
The email should come to you from Eco Team <team@spot.io>. Please ensure your spam filters do not block the email.

Much of the content of the email is in graphical format. Allow your email client to download pictures to get the full benefit of the email.

Recipients must be a direct-to-aws customer. Companies we know to be MSPs and their end-customers will not receive the email.

### Unsubscribe

At the bottom of the email, you have the option to unsubscribe.
