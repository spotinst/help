# Use Stateful Nodes

Using Spotâ€™s stateful node you can quickly [import existing Azure VMs](elastigroup/tutorials-azure/use-stateful-nodes/import-a-stateful-vm) or [create a node from scratch](https://docs.spot.io/managed-instance/azure/getting-started/create-stateful-node) into Elastigroup as new nodes while keeping your stateful resources intact. The platform can also be used as a centralized management and monitoring console for all running stateful nodes (and other workloads), with visibility into cost, logs, configuration settings and more. Stateful nodes can be created in Elastigroup, where you can monitor components, add or remove disks, view the current state of nodes and take actions on a node such as recycle, pause, and resume.

Elastigroup also gives Azure users more flexibility and control over infrastructure for their stateful workloads:
- Increasing the availability of stateful nodes by defining multiple availability zones and spot VM types.
- Improving infrastructure efficiencies by using the built-in scheduling mechanism to determine exact running hours for stateful nodes.
- Easily managing stateful resources such as adding and removing data disks.
- Taking actions on nodes (e.g., pause, resume, recycle, and delete) in just a few clicks.
