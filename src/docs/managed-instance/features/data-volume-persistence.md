# Data Volume Persistence

Data volume persistence maintains the data volumes during spot node replacement. The data on the volumes that were attached at the time of the previous node termination will be present on the new node, using the same BlockDeviceMapping configuration upon node replacement.

The [flow diagram](elastigroup/features/z-stateful-instance/stateful-elastigroup-flow) describes on a high level how Spot manages the persistence of stateful nodes.

## Configure Data Volume Persistence

1. Click Stateful Nodes on the left menu.
2. Choose a node.
3. Click Actions on the top right.
4. Choose Edit Configuration.
5. Click Persistent Resources tab.
6. Mark Persist Root Volume.

Stateful Nodes provide the methods described below for data volume persistence.

### Snapshot Backups

Periodic snapshots of data volumes are taken while the node is running. Upon spot node replacement, a new EBS volume is created from the latest snapshot and is attached to the new node upon launch by updating the block device mapping in the configuration.

### Reattach

This method is recommended for large data volumes. The same EBS volume is detached from the original node and reattached to the newly launched node. If the new node is launched in a different availability zone, a snapshot is used to create a new volume and attach it to the new node (as volumes cannot be migrated between availability zones). Initially, volumes can be created based on the AMI block device mapping upon the stateful node's first resume, or attached via the AWS console. The same volumes are maintained as long as the node is launched within the same availability zone.

## Suspend User Data Execution Until Volumes are Available

When using the Reattach option for data volume persistence, the nodes are launched, followed by the attachment of the volumes. To prevent the user data from executing before the volumes are attached, add the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

EC2_INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
EC2_AVAIL_ZONE=`curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone`
EC2_REGION="`echo \"$EC2_AVAIL_ZONE\" | sed -e 's:\([0-9][0-9]*\)[a-z]*\$:\\1:'`"
DEVICE_NAME="/dev/xvdb"
DATA_STATE="unknown"

until [ "$DATA_STATE" == "attached" ]; do

        DATA_STATE=$(aws ec2 describe-volumes \
                --region $EC2_REGION \
                --filters \
                Name=attachment.instance-id,Values=$EC2_INSTANCE_ID \
                Name=attachment.device,Values=$DEVICE_NAME \
                --query Volumes[].Attachments[].State \
                --output text)

        echo $DATA_STATE
        sleep 5

done

echo "volume is ready"
```

## Stateful Nodes Actions

Stateful Nodes perform various backend actions for different states of the nodes to ensure data volume persistence.

### Running

- Reattach + One AZ: The data volumes are preserved, detached, and attached on every node replacement.
- Snapshot backups or Reattach + Multi AZ: A snapshot is taken for each data volume every five minutes.

### Paused

- Reattach + One AZ: The original EBS volumes are maintained.
- Snapshot backups or Reattach + Multi AZ: Only the latest snapshot for each volume is kept.

### Resume

- Snapshot backups: New volumes are created from the latest snapshots upon node launch.
- Reattach + node launch in same AZ as previous node: The existing volumes are reattached to the new node post launch.
- Reattach + node launch in different AZ from previous node: New volumes are created in the same AZ as the new node and are attached post launch.

### Deallocated

- When you delete a stateful node, you can choose which parts to delete.
- Selected resources will be kept for four days (96 hours) by default and then deleted.
