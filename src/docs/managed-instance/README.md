# Elastigroup Stateful Node

Elastigroup Stateful Node enables you to run stateful applications on stateful nodes. Stateful Node utilizes spot nodes while providing persistence for the root volume, data volumes and network interface, in addition to other launch specifications during node replacements.

Spot nodes are transient and can be interrupted at any moment by AWS. While this is not an issue for stateless applications, as they are designed to easily scale horizontally, this can be challenging for stateful applications.

Spot Stateful Nodes are designed to support any fault-tolerant applications, such as databases and stream-processing servers.  The following are some examples of stateful node uses.

## Development machines

Elastigroup drives innovation by allowing unfettered usage of personal development machines with data and IP persistence even on spot instances. Built-in scheduling helps further reduce cost with full control over when instances run.

## Big data

With data and IP persistence, instance auto-recovery, automated data, cross-AZ multiple shard environments and more, you can reliably utilize spot instances for highly cost-optimized big data clusters.

## Reliability, Efficiency and Cost Savings

With Stateful Node, you can maintain your configurations with zero data loss while taking advantage of the cost savings provided by spot nodes. You can obtain dramatic cost reduction with maximum efficiency for stateful nodes running in AWS and Azure.
