You can filter the events displayed in the table by tags and attributes or search by keyword. You can also choose a timeframe to display, for example, the last 100 days.

On this page, you can also do the following:

- Archive: Archive events you do not want to see in the Trends & Notifications summary table
- Reactivate: Unarchive events so that they may appear in the Trends & Notifications summary table
- Event Definition: [Define new criteria](cloud-analyzer/tutorials/view-trends-notifications/view-all-archive.md) for the system to recognize new irregular events
