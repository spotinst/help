# Connect Master Payer Account: Existing Customer

Use the procedure on this page if you are an existing Spot customer and want to connect your AWS Cost and Usage Reports to start using Cloud Analyzer. If you are a new customer and are connecting to Spot for the first time, use the following procedure: [Connect your AWS Master Payer Account: First Registration](cloud-analyzer/getting-started/connect-master-payer-account-first-registration).

## Prerequisites

- Organization administration permissions in Cloud Analyzer are required to register an organization to Cloud Analyzer.
- Getting started with Cloud Analyzer on AWS requires read-only permissions to the Cost and Usage Reports, which are located in the Master Payer account.

## AWS Region

All actions in this procedure should be made in the US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) AWS region. (This includes generating the CUR file into a bucket in us-east-1.) If there is a problem doing this, please contact Support.

## Get Started

1. Once you log into the Spot Console, go to the Cloud Analyzer Cost Analysis dashboard. You will see the following message:
