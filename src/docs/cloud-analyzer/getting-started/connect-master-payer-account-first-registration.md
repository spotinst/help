# Connect Master Payer Account: First Registration

Use the procedure on this page if you are connecting to Spot for the first time. If you are an existing Spot customer and just want to connect your AWS Cost and Usage Reports to start using Cloud Analyzer, use the following procedure: [Connect your AWS Master Payer Account: Existing Customer](cloud-analyzer/getting-started/connect-your-aws-master-payer-account-existing-customer).

## Prerequisites

- Organization administration permissions in Cloud Analyzer are required to register an organization to Cloud Analyzer.
- Getting started with Cloud Analyzer on AWS requires read-only permissions to the Cost and Usage Reports, which are located in the Master Payer account.

## AWS Region

All actions in this procedure should be made in the US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) AWS region. (This includes generating the CUR file into a bucket in us-east-1.) If there is a problem doing this, please contact Support.

## Get Started

1. Log in to the Spot Console.
2. Click AWS. The connection wizard appears as shown below.
