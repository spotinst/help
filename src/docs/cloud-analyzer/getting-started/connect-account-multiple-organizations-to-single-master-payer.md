# Connect Account: Multiple Organizations To Single Master Payer

Use this procedure if you need to connect multiple Spot organizations to a single Master Payer Account. This procedure enables Cloud Analyzer to access your billing file and provide you with visibility into your cloud expenditures.

## Prerequisite

Organization administration permissions in Cloud Analyzer are required to register an organization to Cloud Analyzer.

## Cost And Usage Report Extraction Setup

There are three major steps to configuring the CUR Extraction:

1. Set up Cost and Usage Reports: This should be done from a root user account.
2. Link your Cost and Usage Report with Athena.
3. Set up the Cost and Usage Extractor.

### Procedure Notes

- AWS Region. All actions in this procedure should be made in the US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) AWS region.
- IAM Role. The IAM role should be the one of the end-customer master payer account.

## Step 1: Set Up Cost And Usage Reports

1. Log in to your root AWS account, then click [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/reports).
2. Click Create Report.
3. Under the first menu, Report Content, do the following:
   1. For the report name, enter (i.e., paste) the following: `spotinst-cur-report`. You must use the same name for the S3 bucket name.
   2. Check the box that says `Include resource IDs`.
   3. Click Next.
4. Under the second menu, Delivery Options, do the following:
   1. Under S3 Bucket, click Configure, then do the following:
      1. For the name for the S3 bucket that CUR reports will be dumped into, paste in the following: `spotinst-cur-report`. This name must be the same as the report name that you entered previously.
      2. Only change the bucket's region if necessary.
      3. Click Next.
      4. Check the box that says `I have confirmed that this policy is correct`.
      5. Click Save.
