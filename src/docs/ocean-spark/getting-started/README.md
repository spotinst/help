# Get Started with Ocean for Apache Spark

Ocean for Apache Spark (also referred to as Ocean Spark) is a managed Spark platform deployed on a Kubernetes cluster in your cloud account.

This section of the documentation walks you through the steps to get started with Ocean Spark.

## Prerequisites

### Create a Spot account

If you don’t have a Spot account yet, you should [create a Spot account](https://console.spotinst.com/spt/auth/signUp). You can do this for free and then add additional users to your Spot organization.

### Communicate your Spot organization ID to the Ocean Spark team.

If the Ocean Spark menu does not appear in the Spot console navigation bar, please provide your Spot organization ID to the Ocean Spark team, so that they can enable the menu for you. If you do not have a contact in the Ocean Spark team yet, [schedule a first call](https://calendly.com/oceanspark/demo) with us.

### Connect your cloud account to Spot

Connect the cloud account in which you intend to deploy Ocean Spark: ([AWS](connect-your-cloud-provider/aws-account))

> **Tip**: Other Spot by NetApp products such as [Eco](eco/) and [Cloud Analyzer](cloud-analyzer/) can give you visibility into your entire cloud spend and help you optimize it, so these products may ask you to connect multiple accounts (or your master billing account). For Ocean Spark, connecting only the account in which you intend to deploy an Ocean Spark cluster is enough.
