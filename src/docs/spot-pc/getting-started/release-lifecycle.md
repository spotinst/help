# Spot PC: Release Lifecycle

Spot PC uses a secure development lifecycle (SDL) process to deploy new features and changes. New code is tested and checked for security compliance before automated systems deploy new versions of each component.
Changes are introduced in two ways. The first is the normal release cycle, which typically utilizes a maintenance window from 10 pm to midnight Eastern (US) Time on alternating Thursday nights.  In some rare cases, the maintenance window can be extended for more complex changes. The second mechanism is a hot fix, which consists of a smaller, more urgent update to one or more components. These fixes are reviewed closely and only made for essential changes to the service.

The Spot PC web application will display a banner several days before a scheduled release to remind administrators of the maintenance window.  In addition, the [NetApp Cloud Services status page](https://status.services.cloud.netapp.com/) will display an update message and status messages that describe the progress and completion of the release. You can also choose to receive these notices via email by clicking the “Subscribe to Updates” link at the top of the status page.
