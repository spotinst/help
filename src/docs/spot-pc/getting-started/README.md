# Spot PC: Getting Started

## Workflow Focused

Spot PC administration is designed around a few simple workflows. Understanding these primary workflows is fundamental to successfully administering Spot PC for your tenant(s).

## Typical Deployment Steps

- Step 1 - [Onboarding Workflow](spot-pc/getting-started/onboarding-workflow)
- Step 2 - [Create VM Image](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-spot-pc?id=create-image)
- Step 3 - [Create Spot Group](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-spot-pc?id=create-spot-group)
- Step 4 - Test the [login as an end user](spot-pc/tutorials/connect-to-desktop)
- Step 5 - Use the [Operational Dashboards](spot-pc/getting-started/?id=operational-dashboards) to monitor and support Spot PC

## Common Management Tasks

- Manage which end users have access to this Spot Group. The guide for [managing users and groups is found here](spot-pc/tutorials/manage-users-and-groups).
- Invite your co-workers to create their own Spot PC admin account(s). The guide for [managing admin accounts is found here](spot-pc/tutorials/manage-admins).
- Edit the Spot Group to make granular changes to how it works. The guide for [editing Spot Groups is found here](spot-pc/tutorials/edit-spot-group).
- Make changes to the image and deploy the new image to the Spot Group. The guide for [deploying image updates is found here](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-image-update).
- Create another tenant for a different customer or Azure AD tenant. The guide for [adding a new Tenant is found here](spot-pc/tutorials/add-tenant).

## Operational Dashboards

Spot PC is built on the prioritization of actionable data. Within each Spot PC tenant there are several dashboards designed to simplify day-to-day operations. On each tab, live data is displayed and updated in real-time. Additional details about these users, machines and security items can be displayed by clicking the individual item from their dashboard. These dashboards include:

- Tenant [Overview](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/overview) Dashboard
- [User Sessions](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/user-sessions) Dashboard
- [Machines](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/machines) Dashboard
- [Data Volumes](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/data-volumes) Dashboard
- [Security](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/security) Dashboard
- [Logs](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/logs) Dashboard
