# Spot PC Tutorial: Enable Support Access

Spot PC makes every effort to maintain your clients' privacy and security. To that end, our support agents have limited read-only access to tenant information. When support issues arises and you wish to engage the support Spot PC support team, you can enable additional access by following this guide.

By enabling support access, you are allowing the Spot PC support team to view User Sessions, Machines, Data Volume info, and Alerts in addition to the basics that can be seen without support access enabled. The Spot PC team will also have access to the Config Actions menu when support access is enabled so they can view and edit images as well as Spot Groups. These additional capabilities allow the team to offer more in-depth troubleshooting and guidance to any issues.

**To enable support access:**
* Log in to the Spot PC web app with an organization administrator account (admin types) and navigate to the tenant where you would like to enable support access.
* Click the arrow next to expand Tenant Details.
* Click the pencil icon next to “Support access enabled” in the bottom right
* Move the toggle to the right
* Set a date for access to expire. Leaving the date field blank will leave support access enabled indefinitely.
