# Spot PC Tutorial: Deploy Windows 365 Cloud PCs

Deploying Windows 365 Cloud PC desktops with Spot PC takes three simple configuration workflows: [Connections](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc?id=create-connection), [Images](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc?id=create-image) and [Provisioning Policies](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc?id=create-provisioning-policy).

NOTE: This is the Windows 365 Cloud PC workflow, for Spot PC, [click here](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-spot-pc).

## Prerequisites

Deploying Windows 365 Cloud PC requires Windows 365 licensing in Azure before the deployment workflow will work. When this licensing is correctly added, an Enterprise Application named "Windows 365" will be present within the Azure portal for this Azure Directory tenant as shown below. Note the changed _Application type and the keyword filter_.

## Create Connection
To begin this workflow, navigate to _Config Actions > Create Connection_ from within the appropriate tenant.

Creating the Connection is the first step towards adding a new (or additional) Windows 365 Cloud PC group. This Connection is analogous to the Spot Group for a Spot PC deployment.

### Select

Select the site for the VM Image to be built (and to reside in) once completed. You can select from all available sites in the tenant.

### Choose Credentials

Enter a Domain Join admin account and password to facilitate the deployment of these Cloud PC desktops. A unique admin account (dedicated to Domain Join actions in Spot PC) for solely this purpose is recommended for security reasons.

### Connection Detail

Enter a name for this Connection.

### Review and Save Configuration

Review your selections, navigate to _previous_ steps to make changes.

### Health Check

Confirms the configuration is healthy.

## Create Image

To begin this workflow navigate to _Config Actions > Create Device Image_ from within the appropriate tenant.

Creating a VM image is the second step towards adding a new (or additional) Windows 365 Cloud PC group. The image will then be assigned to the Windows 365 Connection created in the [next step](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc) of this process.

### Enter Image Name

Enter a name for this image.

### Select Site

Select the site for the VM Image to be built (and to reside in) once completed. You can select from all available sites in the tenant.

### Version

Enter the version of this image for your own tracking and change control.

### Select Source Image

Select an image from the available list.

### Review and Create Device Image

Review your selections, navigate to _previous_ steps to make changes.

## Create Provisioning Policy
To begin this workflow, navigate to _Config Actions > Create Provisioning Policy_ from within the appropriate tenant.

Creating a Provisioning Policy is the third step towards adding a new (or additional) Windows 365 Cloud PC group. The Provisioning Policy links the Connection with the Image and links users to complete the Windows 365 Cloud PC creation process.

### Select Connection

Select the appropriate Connection.

### Select Device Image

Select the appropriate device image. Either a custom image (created above) or an Azure Gallery Image can be used.

### Select Group

Select the existing AD Security Group(s) which contain the users to be assigned to this spot group.

### Provisioning Policy Detail

Enter a policy name and description for your own future reference.

### Review and Save Provisioning Policy

Review your selections, navigate to _previous_ steps to make changes.
