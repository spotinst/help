# Ansible Module Documentation

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

Spot integration with Ansible enables you to use an Ansible module to create, update, and delete resources running with the Spot platform on AWS.

To install the [Spot collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/spot/cloud_modules/) from Ansible Galaxy that contains all Ansible modules, run the following command:
`ansible-galaxy collection install spot.cloud_modules`
