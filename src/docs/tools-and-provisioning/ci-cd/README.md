# CI/CD

Spot easily plugs into your delivery pipeline, including major CI/CD platforms such as [Jenkins](tools-and-provisioning/ci-cd/jenkins.md), and [GitLab](tools-and-provisioning/ci-cd/gitlab.md), and extends your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline of choice with Continuous Optimization (CO) to complete the application delivery pipeline.

Below are just two examples of the many ways Spot turns CI/CD into CI/CD/CO.

## CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Spot

In modern organizations, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) not only streamline the process of code delivery and software deployment, it also plays a significant role in auditing and optimization. For Kubernetes workloads this translates into checking deployment configurations and pod definitions to ensure they are scoped correctly for both CPU and memory allocation. Over-provisioning at this step can lead to resource and infrastructure waste at scale, potentially eliminating any efficiency Kubernetes originally brought to the table.

When you add Spot to your pipeline, you benefit from the addition of "continuous optimization" (CO). Spot ensures that the ongoing resources a cluster needs are handled in the most efficient manner, simplifying Kubernetes infrastructure management while reducing costs by optimizing cluster scaling and pod sizing.
