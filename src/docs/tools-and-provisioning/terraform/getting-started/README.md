# Getting Started with Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom, in-house solutions. Terraform supports many cloud providers and platforms including Spot.

It is really easy to get started to integrate Spot by NetApp with Terraform.

For more information, reference our official provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spotinst/spotinst/latest/docs).

To get started, you can:
