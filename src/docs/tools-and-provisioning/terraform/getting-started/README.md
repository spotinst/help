# Getting Started with Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom, in-house solutions. Terraform supports many cloud providers and platforms including Spot.

It is really easy to get started with Ocean using Terraform, as it provides a simple flow to create an EKS cluster.

To get started, you can:

- Complete the procedures described in the [Spot Ocean Amazon EKS Terraform](https://github.com/spotinst/terraform-spotinst-ocean-eks#spotinst-ocean-amazon-eks-terraform-module) module and use Terraform with Ocean.
- [Install](tools-and-provisioning/terraform/getting-started/install-terraform) and [configure](<(tools-and-provisioning/terraform/getting-started/configuration)>) Terraform.
