# Getting Started with Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom, in-house solutions. Terraform supports many cloud providers and platforms including Spot.

It is really easy to get started to integrate Spot with Terraform.

For more information, reference our official provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spotinst/spotinst/latest/docs).

To get started, you can:

- [Configure](tools-and-provisioning/terraform/getting-started/configuration) Terraform.
