# Resources

Using your existing Terraform templates, you can take full advantage of the Spot platform. You can use the Spot Terraform plugin to interact with the platform, create Elastigroups, containerized workloads (with Ocean), and managed instances. See the [Spot Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/spotinst/index.html) page to take advantage of all the resources available.

## Prerequisite:

You already have a Spot account and have completed the Spot Terraform [Installation](tools-and-provisioning/terraform/getting-started/install-terraform) and [Configuration](tools-and-provisioning/terraform/getting-started/configuration).
