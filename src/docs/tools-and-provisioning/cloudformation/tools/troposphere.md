# Troposphere

[Troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) is a library for creating AWS CloudFormation templates.

The Troposphere library allows easier creation of the [AWS CloudFormation JSON](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) by writing Python code to describe the AWS resources. Troposphere now supports setting up an Elastigroup Custom Resource.
