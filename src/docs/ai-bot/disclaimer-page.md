# Spot AI Support Assistant (AISA) Terms of Use

AISA is our generative AI-powered Support Assistant on the [Spot console](http://console.spotinst.com) 

AISA is designed to respond to questions about Spot services. It can do so based on content available on the [Spot documentation portal](docs.spot.io) and the [Spot Resource Center](https://spot.io/).

This Beta version of AISA creates algorithmically-generated content that might contain errors or inaccuracies. All generated content should be used as a starting point only. You should always verify AISA's responses by referring to Spot's official product documentation. Any reliance on AISA's generated responses is at your own risk, and NetApp is not responsible for any issues or difficulties that may occur by solely using AISA's generated responses.
 Conditions
 By using AISA, you agree to abide by the following rules and stipulations when generating content and responses. Failure to abide by these terms may result in being blocked from using AISA.
 Do not attempt to use AISA to produce content that might cause harm, abuse, violence, or deception.
 Do not try to engage AISA in conversations that are outside the scope of its intended purpose or to get answers to questions that are not about Spot products.
