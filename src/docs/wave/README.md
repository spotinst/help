# Wave

Using Wave, you can automate infrastructure provisioning, management, and scaling for big data cloud environments. Wave simplifies and automates cloud infrastructure for Spark running on Kubernetes.

From setup and configuration to resource provisioning, management, and teardown, Wave uses Spot’s AI-based engine to continuously optimize Spark clusters, choosing the best infrastructure for an application, based on its real-time requirements. Built on top of Spot Ocean, Wave makes it possible to reliably run Spark applications on spot, reserved and on-demand instances, delivering up to 90% cost savings.

## Key Benefits of Wave

Wave enables the teams responsible for deploying and operating big data solutions in the cloud--data platform teams, data infrastructure teams, big data operations teams--to deliver the most reliable, scalable and cost-efficient infrastructure possible. Built on proven Spot by NetApp technology and supporting widely adopted big data technologies, Wave enables organizations to execute Spark jobs in a fraction of the time, at a fraction of the infrastructure cost, and with a fraction of the management burden. Using Wave, you will:

- Eliminate manual infrastructure management. Advanced automation removes operational barriers for provisioning, scaling, and monitoring cloud compute.
- Continuously optimize Spark applications and save up to 90% on infrastructure costs. You will run applications reliably on an optimal mix of spot, on-demand, and reserved instances to minimize cluster footprint and reduce cloud costs.
- Enjoy rich observability into resource utilization. Robust cost metrics and analysis uncovers the true cost of data applications and pipelines in the cloud.
