# Exclude Instance Types in an Ocean Cluster

## Introduction

You can include or exclude certain instance types in your Ocean cluster. Typically, you do it from the cluster configuration.
* **Blacklist**: instance types to block launching in the Ocean cluster. It cannot be used with a permit list.
* **Whitelist**: instance types allowed in the Ocean cluster. It cannot be used with a deny list.
* **Filtering**: list of filters. The instance types that match with all filters make up the Ocean's whitelist parameter. Filtering cannot be used with allow or block lists.

## Instructions

You can allow, [block](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/tips-and-best-practices/manage-machine-types?id=opt-out-of-machine-types), or [filter](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/tips-and-best-practices/manage-machine-types?id=select-instance-types-with-advanced-filters) instance types in the cluster configuration in <i>compute: instanceTypes</i> in the clusterâ€™s JSON or using an API.
