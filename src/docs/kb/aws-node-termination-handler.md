# Ocean | EKS | AWS Node Termination Handler 

## Overview

[AWS node termination handler](https://ec2spotworkshops.com/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/070_selfmanagednodegroupswithspot/deployhandler.html) is a DaemonSet pod that is deployed on each Spot instance. It detects the instance termination notification signal so that there will be a graceful termination of any pod running on that node, drain from load balancers, and redeploy applications elsewhere in the cluster.

AWS node termination handler makes sure that the Kubernetes control plane responds as it should to events that can cause EC2 instances to become unavailable. Some reasons EC2 instances may become unavailable include:
* EC2 maintenance events
* EC2 spot interruptions
* ASG scale-in
* ASG AZ rebalance
* EC2 instance termination using the API or Console

If not handled, the application code may not stop gracefully, take longer to recover full availability, or accidentally schedule work to nodes going down.

The workflow of the node termination handler DaemonSet is:
1. Identify that a Spot Instance is being reclaimed.
2. Use the 2-minute notification window to prepare the node for graceful termination.
3. Taint the node and cordon it off to prevent new pods from being placed.
4. Drain connections on the running pods.
5. Replace the pods on the remaining nodes to maintain the desired capacity.

## Question
Does Ocean conflict with aws-node-termination-handler?

## Answer
Ocean does not conflict with aws-node-termination-handler. It is possible to install it, but using aws-node-termination-handler is not required. Ocean continuously analyzes how your containers use infrastructure, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability.
Ocean ensures that the cluster resources are utilized and scales down underutilized nodes to optimize maximal cost.
