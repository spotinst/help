# Connect AWS Account

You can automatically or manually connect your AWS account to Spot. Customize your account by selecting permissions for specific Spot products and integrations with AWS.  

After you've [created your first Spot organization](connect-your-cloud-provider/first-account/), you need to connect your Spot account to your AWS account as a linked account.

## Connect Automatically

1. After you select AWS as the [cloud provider](connect-your-cloud-provider/first-account/), click **Linked Account** > **Automatically**.

        If a permission bundle is not selected, the list of permissions under it won’t be included in the policy JSON.

        Click **View JSON** to view the permissions in the JSON preview that is updated according to your selection.

    * **Default Permissions** provides the default IAM Policy.

5. Run the IAM template. The IAM Policy is created in the AWS console. Click **Run IAM Template** to generate the IAM policy:

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li>In the AWS console, go to the Capabilities tab, and select <i>I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources</i>.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Create stack</b> and return to the Spot console.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Connect</b>.</li>

## Edit a Policy

If you need to edit the policy after you create the account, you need to [update it directly in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html).

You can search for the policy using `spotinst-iam-stack`.
