# Running Hours in the Spot Console and AWS

Running hours are calculated from the moment an instance is launched until it is <i>detached</i> and not <i>terminated</i>. AWS calculates the entire lifetime of the instance.

* Groups of instances with long draining periods
* Shutdown scripts with long grace periods
