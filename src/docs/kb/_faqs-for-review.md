   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="AWSIAM">Can I remove permissions from the Spot IAM policy?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">
   
You can choose to remove some of these permissions from the [Spot IAM policy](/administration/api/spot-policy-in-aws):

* **iam:PutRolePolicy** is not required as it is only used if the instance profile itself needs to create inline policies.
* **iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole** is only needed for an initial spot request, then it can be removed. This means it's only required to create the first spot instance in your account. After creating an Ocean or Elastigroup and launching a Spot instance through Spot, you can remove this permission from the policy.
* **iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile** is generally not required. It is only used to change the role associated with an instance profile and is required for Beanstalk.
* **iam:PassRole** is only required when you custom metrics. Ocean EKS does not require <i>iam:PassRole</i> in the Spot policy. However, if you use custom metrics, you need an account with this role configured for putting metric data into CloudWatch, which is in use by both Ocean (PublishOceanKubernetesCwMetricsExecutor ) and EG (ReportCWMetricsNewCmd).

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="SSO-groupokta">SSO: How can I add a user to groups in an organization in Okta?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   You can configure a user to one or many user groups under a certain [organization](/administration/sso-access-control/organization-level-sso?id=organization-and-user-group) in Okta spotinst application:
1.	Make sure [Okta SAML 2.0 authentication](/administration/identity-providers/okta-saml-authentication) is configured with Spot.
2.	Sign in to Okta Admin, go to **Directory** > **Profile Editor**, and select **Spotinst User**.
3.	Click **Add Attribute** and add a custom attribute:
    * **Data Type**: <i>string</i>
    * **Display Name**: <i>OrgAndUserGroups</i>
    * **Variable Name**: <i>OrgAndUserGroups</i>

4. Click **Save**.
5. In Okta Admin, go to **Applications** > **Applications**, and select **Spotinst app**.
6. On the Sign On tab, add this custom attribute under the **SAML 2.0 settings**:
   * **Attribute Name**: <i>OrgAndUserGroups</i>
   * **Name Format**: <i>Unspecified</i>
   * **Value**: <i>appuser.OrgAndUserGroups</i>

7. Generate a [new certificate](/administration/identity-providers/okta-saml-authentication) and upload it to your Spot Organization.
8. Add users to groups:
   <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
   <li>For each user in your organization who needs to be assigned to groups, go to Okta Admin <b>Directory</b> > <b>People</b>.</li>
   <li>On the Applications tab, locate the Spotinst app and click <b>Edit</b> to add the <i>OrgAndUserGroups</i>:</li>
      <ul>

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="SSO-oktaerror">SSO: Why am I getting a user provisioning error in Okta?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

You cannot sign in to your Spot org due to a user provisioning error in your Okta SSO environment. For example, you're getting one of these errors:

*	<code>Automatic provisioning of user {name of user} to app Spotinst failed: Matching user not found.</code>
* <code>Automatic profile push of user {name of user} to app Spotinst failed: Error while trying to push profile update for {user email}: No user returned for user {user id}</code>

When either of these errors occurs, you see in the Kibana log:
<code>Unhandled Exception! Need to investigate the request</code>
</code>{org id} and "SSO" in logstash-ums*</code>

These internal logging errors occur because of a misconfiguration in the Okta SSO environment.
1.	Make sure edit is set up for provisioning:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Go to Okta Admin Console and click <b>Applications</b> > <b>Spotinst</b> > <b>Provisioning</b> > <b>To App</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> and then <b>Enable</b> for <i>Create Users</i>, <i>Update User Attributes</i>, and <i>Deactivate Users</i>.</li>
    </ol>
 
2.	Check for failed tasks:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Go to the Okta Admin Console and navigate to <b>Dashboard</b> > <b>Tasks</b>. Look for failed provisioning assignments under <b>Tasks</b>.</li>
    <li>If there are failed tasks for the users who were getting errors, retry the tasks by selecting the task and then clicking <b>Retry Selected</b>b>.</li>
    </ol>

    After retrying the failed tasks, the errors should be resolved and the users should have complete access to the Spotinst app after signing in using SSO. If there are no failed tasks associated with these users or if the issue isn’t resolved, unassign them.
   
3.	Unassign the users from the Spotinst app in Okta. Once unassigned, reassign these specific users to the Spotinst app.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanvmarch">Can I create VMs with specific architecture in Ocean AKS?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">
  
You may want to run workloads (pods) on VMs with a specified architecture.

For Ocean clusters (AWS), you can use an AMI with the required architecture. Update the AMI in the cluster or virtual node group (VNG) configuration to make sure the instances are launched according to the architecture specified in the AMI.

However, it’s not possible to do with Ocean AKS clusters because you cannot choose a particular image to run VMs when you create an AKS cluster.

1.	Create a new virtual node group in the Ocean AKS cluster and configure it manually or import the configuration of a node pool.
2.	Add vmSizes to the virtual node group JSON file.
    <pre><code>"vmSizes": {
        "filters": {
            "architectures": [
                 "x86_64"
            ],
            "series": []
                }
    }</code>
   </pre>
   
   * <b>Architectures</b> is a list of strings, and the values can be: <i>x86_64</i> (includes both <i>intel64</i> and <i>amd64</i>), <i>intel64</i>, <i>amd64</i>, and <i>arm64</i>.
     <font color="#FC01CC">I don't understand this: The filtered VM sizes support at least one of the architectures from this list.</font>

   * Add <b>series</b> with the VM series for the particular architecture.
     For example, run VMs with <i>arm64</i> and launch the VMs with <i>Dps_V5</i> as the series.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanallocationutilization">What's the difference between allocation and utilization for Ocean right sizing?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">
  
Estimating the proper amount of CPU and memory when assigning resource requests to workloads is a challenge that teams face when designing Kubernetes or ECS clusters. To address this challenge and create even more resource-efficient clusters, Ocean has implemented a right-sizing recommendation mechanism.

Right-sizing recommendations are provided per container and summarized for the entire workload for easy presentation at a high level. Recommendations per container enable you to easily understand exactly which applications require changes in resource requests and implement those changes quickly.

Applying the changes suggested by those notifications helps utilize resources in the cluster in a more precise manner and lowers the chances of cluster issues resulting from under- or over-utilization of resources.

Sometimes, there’s a difference between the number of resources in use in the Spot console and AWS.

Ocean performs scaling according to allocation. There are times when a pod’s request fully utilizes the number of resources allocated. Ocean’s scaling takes this into consideration. This is why a discrepancy may occur. The workload can use fewer resources than the number of resources that were initially allocated or requested.

Ocean’s solution to this mismatch is a feature called [Right Sizing](/ocean/features/right-sizing). The Right Sizing tab shows the discrepancy between the number of resources allocated (Requested) and the number of resources that are currently utilized (Recommended). This can help you make changes to your current resource utilization.

![oceanrightsizing1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/499116be-1d13-45bf-9ca4-fc57d4b3bd3a)

In the Recommendations table, you can see the exact amount of resources to change from the pod’s request.

Registering a container instance with an ECS cluster means you are telling the ECS service that a specific EC2 instance is available to run containers. <font color="#7632FE">You give information to ECS about the EC2 instance, such as its IP address, the docker daemon endpoint. ##is this part useful?##</font>

<font color="#FC01CC">If a container instance is not able to register the cluster, traffic is not received and the cluster does not function. ##what does this mean? what's the result if this happens##</font>

* **AMI**

  ECS is optimized and Agent (similar to the controller in Kubernetes) is configured in the AMI.
  
* **Security group and specific ports**
  * **Port 22 (SSH)** is required if you want to connect to your container instances using Secure Shell (SSH) for troubleshooting or maintenance.
    It is not directly related to ECS cluster registration, but it's commonly included for administrative access to the instances.
  * **Port 2375 (TCP)** is used for the ECS container agent to communicate with the ECS control plane. It allows the agent to register the container instance with the cluster, send heartbeats, and receive instructions for task placement and management.
  * **Port 2376 (TCP)** is used for secure communication between the ECS container agent and the ECS control plane. It enables encrypted communication and is recommended for improved security when managing your ECS cluster.

* **IAM role**

  Configure an instance profile with relevant permissions.

* **IP**

  Make sure you configured Public IP according to subnet, and have NAT gateway.
  If you change the configuration in the virtual node group, such as tags/user data, it immediately overrides the cluster's configuration.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   When the <code>useAsTemplateOnly</code> parameter is <i>true</i>, you cannot edit the target capacity in the Ocean cluster configuration.
   
Keep in mind that it may not be necessary to increase the target capacity because Ocean automatically scales instances up and down as needed.

If you want to edit the target capacity:
1. In the [API](https://docs.spot.io/api/#tag/Ocean-AWS/operation/OceanAWSClusterCreate), go to **Compute** > **launchSpecification**.
2. Change the <b>useAsTemplateOnly</b> parameter to <i>false</i>.

This will let you manually increase the target of the duster and the nodes will launch in the default virtual node group.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

You can restrict specific pods from scaling down by configuring Ocean and Kubernetes. The instance will be replaced only if:
* It goes into an unhealthy state.
* Forced by a cloud provider interruption.

There are two options for restricting pods from scaling down:
* Kubernetes deployments/pods: spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down: true

  Use the <code>spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down</code> label set to <i>true</i> to block proactive scaling down for more efficient bin packing. This will leave the instance running as long as possible. It gets defined as a label in the pod's configuration. See [restrict scale down](ocean/features/labels-and-taints?id=spotinstiorestrict-scale-down).

* Virtual node group (VNG): restrict scale down (only available for AWS, ECS, and GKE)

  You can configure [Restrict Scale Down](ocean/features/vngs/attributes-and-actions-per-vng) at the VNG level so the nodes and pods within the VNG are not replaced or scaled down due to the auto scaler resource optimization.  Create a VNG, go to the Advanced tab, then select **Restrict Scale Down**.

This can happen when the pod has a claim for a specific volume owned by a different instance, and that instance does not have free space for the pod.

By freeing up space, the pod can be placed on its attached node and can use the volume it claimed.

Cost Analysis in the Ocean Dashboard can show an unusually high cost for yesterday.

![oceancostanalysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96cbe1c7-fa63-4df1-89bb-18154e9778cb)

If you look at the same day a few days later, the cost will be similar to the other days.

![oceancostanalysis2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a11a3a9-a2b1-405a-b274-c2a5370bff43)

Spot's Cost Analysis reviews the cost data after one day. For instance, if today is August 20, the cost analysis data will be finalized only on August 21.

Initially, the costs are compared with the on demand value of the instance types, followed by the Spot value. Afterwards, the costs are compared with reserved instances and saving plans. So, if the you have reserved instances and saving plans configured, the cost gap from the previous day can be higher.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceancooldowneval">What's the difference between cooldown period and evaluation period?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">
  
Whenever Spot performs a scaling action, there is a cooldown period during which no further scaling action takes place. After the cooldown period, another scaling action can take place if required.

**Cooldown Period**

The cooldown period is the amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes before any further trigger-related scaling activities can start.

For example, if scaling policy A has cooldown set to 60 seconds and a scale-down is triggered, then new scale-downs cannot start because of policy A for the next minute. New policies cannot go into effect while policy A is in cooldown.

Cooldown period is the amount of time, in seconds, that Ocean must wait between scaling actions.

**Evaluation Period**

The specific number of evaluation periods before a scale-down action takes place. Each cycle is one minute. Evaluation period is the length of time to collect and evaluate the metric.

> **Note**: The evaluation period is calculated based on cooldown plus 3 minutes of padding due to delay in Cloudwatch metrics. So if the cooldown is set to 300 seconds, the evaluation period is 8 minutes (3 minutes + 5 cooldown).

<font color="#FC01CC">are the 2 hyperlinks below correct?</font>

You can set [Equal AZ Distribution](https://docs.spot.io/elastigroup/features/core-features/equal-az-instance-distribution-orientation?id=equal-az-instance-distribution-orientation) for cluster orientation in Elastigroup. Despite this, Spot may prioritize a certain availability zone to maintain equal distribution. 

An [Elastigroup may have Equal AZ Distribution](https://docs.spot.io/elastigroup/features/core-features/equal-az-instance-distribution-orientation?id=equal-az-instance-distribution-orientation) set for cluster orientation, but the system sometimes prioritizes a certain availability zone to maintain equal distribution. When no spot instances are available, an on-demand instance spins up in the relevant availability zone.

An on-demand instance may not start, for example, if it hits an AWS instance type limit. This is like an on-demand instance that didn’t launch successfully and was replaced with spot instances in a different market.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

When you import a new group to Elastigroup, you may get this error:
<code>"value" contains a conflict between exclusive peers [resourceRequirements, spot]</code>

This happens if the <code>resourceRequirements</code> value is <i>null</i>.

Remove the <i>resourceRequirements</i> field from the JSON file and reimport the group.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="egmemoryscalepolicy">How can I set a memory-based scaling policy in Elastigroup?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

Scaling policies typically include CloudWatch metrics such as CPU utilization, network out, and latency.

You can configure a custom scaling policy that is based on another metric. For example, you may want to scale according to memory utilization.

1.	To set a simple scaling policy, revert the Elastigroup configurations to the legacy design:

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
     <li>In the Spot console, go to <b>Elastigroup</b> > <b>Groups</b>, and click on the name of an Elastigroup.</li>
     <li>Go to <b>Actions</b> > <b>Edit Configuration</b>.</li>
     <li>Click <b>Revert to Legacy Design</b>.
     
     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd8803d-a05b-4850-82e1-e87104006879" />
     </li>

    </ol>

2.	Click <b>Scaling</b> > <b>Simple Scaling Policies</b>.
3.	Select <b>Up Scaling Policies</b> or <b>Down Scaling Policies</b> and click <b>Add Policy</b>.
4.	Set these parameters:
    * <b>Policy Type</b>: <i>Simple scaling</i>
    * <b>Source</b>: <i>AWS CloudWatch</i>
    * <b>Auto Scale Based On</b>: <i>Other</i>
    * <b>Namespace</b>: <i>Custom</i>
    * <b>Custom Namespace</b>: <i>CWagent</i>
    * <b>Metric Name</b>: this [AWS document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html) contains the metrics you can use. These metrics are collected by the CloudWatch agent. For example, you can use <i>mem_used</i> or <i>mem_used_percent</i>.
     
     <img width=450 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/430e1adc-458b-4723-ba8a-061c766daef3" >
    
5. Verify the [CloudWatch agent is installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-EC2-Instance.html).

The next steps are intuitive and should be configured according to the customer's considerations.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="egnomad">How is Nomad integrated with Elastigroup?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

Nomad is an open-source system by Hashicorp. It is used to easily manage containerized applications across multiple hosts.

Nomad groups your containers into logical units, called jobs, to simplify management and discovery. It provides deployment scheduling, workload, resource usage optimization, and easy scaling. Its workload management, scalability, and flexibility are simple and lightweight to use.

Nomad and Kubernetes are popular container orchestration platforms for managing and scaling containerized applications. However, they have different design philosophies and features.

<img width=700 src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1ea38cb-33a5-447f-9556-3c5f23b0e03d" >

With the Nomad integration, you can easily set up a new group by adding the required user data script and providing the Nomad lead master-server IP and primary host and port.

Add <i>setup data dir</i> to your AMI. Replace `<NomadServerElasticIP>` with the Elastic IP of the master:

<pre><code># Setup data dir
data_dir = "/tmp/client1"
# Enable the client
client {
    enabled = true
    servers = ["<NomadServerElasticIP>"]
}</code></pre>
 
<b>Create an Elastigroup with Nomad:</b>

1.	Create a new Elastigroup for [AWS](/elastigroup/getting-started/create-an-elastigroup-for-aws), [Azure](/elastigroup/getting-started/create-an-elastigroup-for-azure), or [GCP](/elastigroup/getting-started/create-an-elastigroup-for-gcp).

2.	On the Compute tab, go to <b>Additional Configurations</b>, add this user data script:

    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
    export INSTANCE_ID=`curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id` <font color="#FC01CC">keep the url as is?</font>
    sudo nomad agent -config client.hcl -node $INSTANCE_ID &</code></pre>

3.	On the Compute tab, go to <b>3rd party integration</b> and select <b>Nomad</b>.
4.	Enter your <b>Nomad Master Host</b> and <b>Port</b>.
5.	Click <b>Validate</b> to make sure the connection is successful.
6.	Create the Elastigroup. <font color="#FC01CC">Click Next how do they create the elastigroup?</font>

        "optimizationWindows": null,
   </code></pre>

5. Recycle the stateful node. <font color="#FC01CC">How do you recycle?</font>
6. Make sure the stateful node is not running on the Spot VM. <font color="#FC01CC">How do you check?</font>
7. Go to <b>Edit Node</b> and delete the node.
