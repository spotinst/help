# Connect your AWS Account to Spot

In this procedure, you will connect your cloud provider account to Spot in order to provide the Spot platform with a set of permissions to manage instances on your behalf.

Watch a step-by-step [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/csPmq3JZlgU/) on connecting your AWS account to Spot.

1. Log in to [Spot Console](http://console.spotinst.com/).
2. Select Amazon Web Services as the cloud provider in which your account resides.

> **Tip**: Prior to connecting your AWS account, you can access a demo system to get familiar with the dashboard. In the Spot Console, click Get a Console Walkthrough.

3. Complete the steps as shown in the online form. The example below shows the form for a new Spot customer. If you have already connected Cloud Analyzer or Eco, the form will be shorter than the one below.
