# Connect an Additional Account

Once you have completed your Spot registration and connected your first account (either a linked or a managed account), you can connect additional accounts to your Organization in Spot. Your additional accounts can be from the same cloud provider or from different ones (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

## Get Started

Go to **Insights & Recommendations** in the Dashboard. When you open the Spot console or when you have connected a cloud provider for the first time, this is the default view.

### From the User Menu

You can create a new account from the account menu.

## Step 1: Create your Spot Account

### Linked Account

To create an additional account for using Elastigroup or Ocean, you need to create a Linked Account. Under Insights & Recommendations, click **Connect a Linked Account**.

### Management Account

To create a Management Account, click **Connect a Management Account**. You can have only one management account per organization. If you already have a management account, this option will not appear under Insights & Recommendations.

## Step 3: Connect your Cloud Account

Complete the steps for connecting your cloud account. If you chose AWS or GCP, you will need to choose whether to connect automatically or manually, as you did when you connected your first account. For Azure, you do not need to choose.
