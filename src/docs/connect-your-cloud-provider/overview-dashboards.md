# Overview Dashboards

The dashboards in Overview offer a comprehensive platform for monitoring, optimizing, and analyzing your cloud infrastructure:

* The [overview dashboard](connect-your-cloud-provider/dashboard) gives you a high-level view of your cloud environment. You can see insights and recommendations, potential savings, and an overview of savings for the Spot products you are using.
* The [optimization dashboard](connect-your-cloud-provider/optimize) shows key areas in your accounts where you can get significant savings, either costs or vCPU hours.
* The [cost analysis](connect-your-cloud-provider/cost-analysis/) page gives you insights into past, current, and future cloud costs.
