## Step 4: Enter your Information in the Spot Console

3. Select View and Copy Policy, and Copy Policy to clipboard.

## Step 5: Provide Permissions to the Active Directory Application

Now that you have created an Active Directory Application, you will create a custom role and attach it to the application.

1. Create a Custom Role

   - Under All Services, select Subscriptions. Choose the subscription you would Spot to access.
   - In the Subscription menu, select Access Control (IAM).
   - Click Roles, Add, and Add Custom Role.
   - Select JSON.
   - Copy and paste the Policy from Step 4. [Spot Policy in Azure](administration/api/spot-policy-in-azure)
   - Review and click Create.

2. Attach the Role
   - Click Role Assignments, Add, and Add Role Assignment.
   - Enter the custom role created above.
   - Enter and select the application created in Step 1.
