# Connect Azure Subscription

This page describes the procedures for connecting your Microsoft Azure subscription to Spot. The procedure assumes that you are following the instructions in the [onboarding wizard](connect-your-cloud-provider/first-account/?id=connect-azure), have already created your Spot organization or new account, and selected Azure as your cloud provider. You are connecting a linked account, and are in Step 3 as shown below.

## Step 3: Connect your cloud account to Spot

> **Tip**: If this is the first account you are connecting, the step below will show as 3.2. If you are connecting an additional account, the step below is numbered 3.1. The examples in this procedure show as if you are connecting an additional account.

### Step 3.1: Log in to Azure

Log in to the Azure account you would like Spot to connect to then continue to the next step.

### Step 3.5: Custom Role

1. Under All Services, select Subscriptions. Choose the subscription you would like Spot to access.
2. In the Subscription menu, select Access Control (IAM).
3. Click Roles, Add, and Add Custom Role.
4. Select JSON. To view the JSON of the full Spot by NetApp policy in Azure, click [here](https://docs.spot.io/administration/api/spot-policy-in-azure?id=spot-policy-in-azure).  
5. Switch to the wizard in Spot and click Export JSON Policy. This will put the correct policy on the clipboard.
6. Return to the Azure console, paste in the policy, review, and click Create.

### Step 3.6: Role Assignment

In this step, you assign the role you created in the previous step and complete everything you need for the connection.

1. In Azure, Click Role Assignments, Add, and Add Role Assignment.
2. Enter the custom role created above.
3. Select the application you registered in Step 3.2.

Once the validation is complete, your Azure subscription will be connected and ready for optimization.
