# View Dashboard

The Dashboard provides a compute overview of your entire organization. On the Dashboard, you can see insights and recommendations, potential savings, and an overview of savings for the Spot products you are using, including Elastigroup, Ocean, and Eco.

## Go to the Dashboard

If you have just connected your cloud account using one of the connection wizards in the Spot console, you will see the Dashboard, by default, when you complete the wizard.

If you are at some other location in the Spot console, go to Overview at the top of the left sidebar and click Dashboard.

The main areas of the dashboard are described below.

## Insights & Recommendations

Once you have connected your cloud provider, Spot provides recommendations based on your cloud provider(s), the kind of account you connected (e.g., linked account or management account), and the resources existing in your cloud account.

If Spot presents a lot of recommendations, be sure to click View All so that you can see all the recommendations for savings and optimization. Any of the following recommendations could appear (and possibly others).
- Connect a Linked Account: You can link additional accounts to Spot, including accounts from different cloud providers.
- Connect a Management Account: This enables you to use Eco (AWS only). Will appear if you do not already have a management account.
- Invite more users to Spot: This opens the user administration in Spot where you can add more users in your organization. Appears only if you have administrator rights in Spot.
- Create your first Elastigroup: Appears if you have no Elastigroup.
- Create your first Stateful Node: Appears if you have no Stateful Node.
- Create your first Ocean Cluster: Appears if you have no Ocean cluster.
- Set up your Strategy for Eco: Appears if you have already connected a management account.

Additional recommendations for connections, imports, and integrations may appear depending on what Spot detects in your cloud, for example, Connect your EKS Cluster to Ocean, Import MongoDB to Stateful Node, Use Jenkins with Elastigroup, and many others.

## Potential Savings

Spot analyzes the instances you have in your cloud provider account and provides estimates of amounts you could save by using Spot to manage your workloads and commitments. Analyses are presented for containers, elastic applications, commitments, and resource groups.

<img src="/connect-your-cloud-provider/_media/view-dashboard-002.png" />

- Containers: Recommendation and estimate of savings if you would run your container workload on spot instances instead of on-demand instances.
- Elastic Applications: Recommendation and estimate of savings if you would run your application workload on spot instances instead of on-demand instances.
- Commitments: Recommendation and estimate of savings if you would run your workload on a portfolio of reserved instances and savings plans instead of on-demand instances.
- Resource Groups: Recommendation and estimate of savings if you would run your workload on spot instances instead of on Azure resources.

Each preview contains the number of instances in that category currently running, an estimation of additional savings that could be obtained using optimization, and the potential savings percentage.
The Reservations preview appears only if you are connected to AWS with a management account.

### View All

Potential Savings information is presented per cloud provider that you have connected to Spot. If you have connected multiple cloud providers, there may be more than the three boxes shown by default. To see all of them, click View All.

## Savings Overview

The Savings Overview gives you a full picture of your savings across your entire organization. The different charts – including Savings over Time, Compute Lifecycle Breakdown, and Potential vs. Actual Cost – enable you to understand the savings in different slices.

### Filters

The filters enable you to select and display only the data you want to see.
- Account: Select one or more accounts to include in the charts below. You need to have a management account in order to use this filter.
- Date: Choose a data range for the data displayed.

### Summary Line

The tiles in the summary line provide some statics to give you an overview of your savings.

<img src="/connect-your-cloud-provider/_media/view-dashboard-004.png" />

- Savings Percentage: The ratio of the organization's potential cost to the actual cost after using Spot’s services.
- Total Saved: The organization’s savings amount in the timeframe you selected.
- Potential Cost: The organization's calculated cost if no spot instances were used.
- Actual Cost: The organization’s cost after using Spot’s services.

### Savings over Time

The default view of this bar chart shows savings over the last year, viewing one bar per month. If you are using both Ocean and Elastigroup, the information is broken down per Spot service.

### Compute Lifecycle Breakdown

This is a pie chart showing your use of spot, on-demand, savings plans, and reserved instances. The lifecycle breakdown represents the current status of your cloud and is not affected by the time filter.

<img src="/connect-your-cloud-provider/_media/view-dashboard-006.png" width="450" />

### Potential vs. Actual Cost

Use this chart to see how well you saved each month. For each month, you see a comparison of your potential cost vs. the actual cost using Spot.
