# Instance Actions

## Manually Detach Instances from Elastigroups

You can simply check a specific instance or multiple instances you want to detach using the Actions button. This will remove the instance/instances and launch new ones.

In the dialog, make sure to keep `Decrement Group's Capacity` unchecked if you want replacement instances to be launched.

Draining Timeout – Specify the time to keep the instance active before terminating it.

Decrement Group's Capacity – Change the group Instance count Target reducing it by a single instance – This will mean no replacement instance will be launched.

## Lock an Instance

You can Lock specific instances to prevent them from being scaled down during autoscaling. Simply select the instance you want to lock and use Actions-> Lock:

You can then define the time for the instance to be locked.

**Tip**: This will protect the instance from Scaling action – however, this will not prevent a spot interruption if one occurs.
