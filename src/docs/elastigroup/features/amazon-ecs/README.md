# Amazon ECS

Elastigroup uses machine learning and analytics to automate and optimize cloud infrastructure on AWS, Azure, and GCP, freeing application teams to focus on their applications, without worrying about their infrastructure.

Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS.

Elastigroup handles the provisioning, managing, and scaling of the underlying cluster on which your containers run and provides container-driven autoscaling â€“ meaning that it will scale the infrastructure up and down based on the ECS task requirements.

By utilizing spot instances for your cluster, Elastigroup delivers savings of up to 80% on your compute costs.
