# Elastic MapReduce

Amazon's Elastic MapReduce (EMR) provides a managed big data framework that enables you to easily add and remove cluster capacity to meet your requirements. EMR supports Hadoop, Apache Spark, and other popular distributed frameworks. Running your EMR clusters on Elastigroup provides you with the significant discounts that Spot instances offer while maintaining 100% availability.

Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools. Amazon EMR makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale your big data environments by automating time-consuming tasks like provisioning capacity and tuning clusters.

There are several advantages to running EMR with Spot including:

- Optimization between cost reduction and processing time
- Support of an on-demand instance as primary
- In some cases, Spot creates more than one task instance group resulting in further cost reduction.
