# Tools and Integrations

We make it really easy for you to use Elastigroup with tools and processes you already have in place. Elastigroup works with leading cloud platforms, services, and tools so that you can simplify and automate your cloud infrastructure wherever your workloads and applications run and however you run them.

This section provides the information and procedures you can use to integrate Elastigroup in your current environment.

To get started, choose an integration from the sidebar on the left.

Learn about additional integrations supported by the Spot platform (such as Terraform, CloudFormation, Spinnaker, and others) under [Tools and Provisioning](ocean/tools-and-provisioning/).
