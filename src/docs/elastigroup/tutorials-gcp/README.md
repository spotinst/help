Spot by NetApp, in partnership with Google Cloud, offers users of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) the opportunity to leverage the benefits of Google Spot VMs. These Spot VMs enhance the existing spare capacity offering of preemptible VMs and provide users with even greater cost savings and fewer restrictions. 

Spot by NetApp extends its support to the Google Spot VMs for users utilizing Elastigroup to manage their workloads' infrastructure.

With the combination of Google Spot VMs and Spot by NetApp, users can benefit from the following:

* **Cost Savings**: Elastigroup enables users to take advantage of the cost savings offered by Google's spare capacity without the risk of service interruption. By leveraging machine learning and predictive algorithms, Elastigroup can anticipate when a Spot VM might be reclaimed and proactively replace it, ensuring uninterrupted operation.

* **Mission-Critical Workloads**: Elastigroup, backed by an enterprise Service Level Agreement (SLA), empowers users to run mission-critical and production workloads on Spot VMs. This ensures that even demanding workloads can benefit from the cost-efficiency of Spot VMs without compromising reliability.

Google Cloud users can optimize their infrastructure costs, automate workload management, and benefit from the Google Spot VMs by unlocking their full potential while ensuring a reliable cloud infrastructure experience.
