# Elastigroup for Azure

Elastigroup for Azure is an IaaS Optimization platform that allows you to provision, manage and scale compute infrastructure to support any Elastic Application or Load Balanced workload.

Microsoft Azure spot virtual machines are allocated from Microsoft Azure's excess compute capacity, enabling workloads to run for a reduced cost of up to 90% less.

With spot virtual machines, Microsoft effectively lets you borrow unused capacity for a great price. However, this capacity can be reclaimed at a moment's notice due to higher priority allocations, making it a less-than-ideal candidate for production workloads. Elastigroup for Azure changes that.

Based on historical and statistical data, Spot's Elastigroup predicts preemptions ahead of time and automatically migrates instances into different machine types, zones, or fallbacks to regular priority (on-demand virtual machines) to ensure high availability and consistency. Elastigroup also ensures that the preemption is done gradually to ensure service uptime.
