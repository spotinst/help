# Import an Existing Autoscaling Group

In this procedure, you will import the configuration of an existing AWS Autoscaling Group (ASG) to Spot so that the ASG can be managed as an Elastigroup in Spot.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with autoscaling groups configured
- A Spot account connected to an AWS account

## Get Started

1. In the left menu of the Spot Console, click Elastigroup/Groups, and click Create Elastigroup.
2. Click Autoscaling Group and choose Create an Elastigroup from an existing Auto Scaling Group.
3. Choose the Region and then choose the ASG you will use to create an Elastigroup cluster. Click Select.

Spot creates the Elastigroup based on the ASG parameters imported from AWS. A summary of the parameters appears with the Review tab open. You can review the list of parameters.

## Scaling Tab

Under the Scaling tab, you can configure scaling and termination policies, in cases that you will need to scale instances to support the load of your web application.

## Review Tab

In the Review tab under Summary, you can review the final configuration of your Elastigroup. In addition, the Spot automatically generates a template of your Elastigroup to be used by Cloudformation or Terraform.

When you are finished reviewing and making modifications to the configuration, click Create. Spot will create your Elastigroup.
