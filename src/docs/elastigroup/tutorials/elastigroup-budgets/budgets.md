# Budgets

Elastigroup Budgets is a cost control tool embedded in the Elastigroup platform.

With Elastigroup Budgets, you have the capability to monitor and control your workload budget on a weekly basis, and in addition to that, identify upcoming spending trends.

Elastigroup Budgets allows you to set a soft budget on each and every one of your workloads, and once the budget threshold exceeds, we will notify you by email or SMS.

In the following tutorials, we will cover exactly how to define a budget for an Elastigroup Cluster, and in addition to that, provide insights on how to monitor the configured budgets.
