There are two methods to set a budget for an Elastigroup:

In the table-view list, Spot will present all the Elastigroups that are part of your account, and which don't have a budget configured yet.

The table will present the Elastrigroups with the following fields:

- Elastigroup Name
- Elastigroup ID
- Last Month Spend – Operational costs of the EG last month
- Month to Date Spend – Operational costs of the EG so far

2. Thresholds

For a threshold you have the option to define 2 types of variables:

- Percentage of the budget: For example, 75% of the budget.
  - A threshold can be over 100%. For example 150% of the budget
- Dollars: For example, 200\$.

In addition to that, for each threshold you configure, you have the option to select the alerting type, either email or SMS.

According to your requirements, you can define several thresholds for an EG.

After you have completed the budget configuration, click on `Set Budget` on the bottom right corner.

That's It! Your Budget is all set!
