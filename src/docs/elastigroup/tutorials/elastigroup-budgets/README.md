# Elastigroup Budgets

Elastigroup Budgets provides you with budget management capabilities for all of your clusters.

Functions such as setting budgets to clusters, defining alert thresholds, together with an Email\SNS notification in case of budget deviation, provide you with deeper visibility and control over your cloud expenses.

With Elastigroup Budgets, you have the ability to monitor and control your workload budget on a weekly basis, and in addition to that, identify upcoming spending trends.

Elastigroup Budgets allows you to set a soft and hard limit budget on your workload, and once the budget threshold is exceeds, Elastigroup will notify you.
