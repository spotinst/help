# Deploy an Elastigroup

A Deployment is a process in which all of the instances running in an Elastigroup are detached and new instances are launched to replace them. A deployment is required when you update a software version and whenever you make changes to certain parameters in the Elastigroup configuration.

This tutorial describes how a deployment works, the procedure for running a deployment, and information that Elastigroup provides about a deployment.

## Relevance

This tutorial is relevant for users of Elastigroup with AWS. For Elastigroup with Azure, see [Deploy an Elastigroup](elastigroup/tutorials/azure/deploy-an-elastigroup).

## When to Deploy

You need to run a deployment in the following cases:

- If you update the application or make any changes to the image.
- If you make any orchestration changes. There is no way to change the orchestration on running instances so a new deployment is required for the changes to take effect.

## How it Works

Instead of deploying an entire Elastigroup at the same time, a deployment runs in groups of instances called batches. This simplifies tracking of system health and facilitates troubleshooting if necessary.

When you set up a deployment, you will define a batch size and a grace period.

### Batch Size

This is the size of each batch in the deployment as a percent of the total number of instances in the group.
For example, a group with 50 instances and a batch size of 20% will be deployed in five separate batches of 10 instances each.

### Grace Period

When the deployment of a batch starts, Elastigroup waits until the instances are healthy before starting the next batch. The instance is considered healthy when it meets the criteria defined in your [health check setting](elastigroup/features/compute/autohealing?id=configure-autohealing-health-check-type). If less than 50% of the instances are healthy, then the deployment will fail. The Grace Period parameter is the maximum time that Elastigroup will wait for the instances to be healthy before the deployment of the next batch will start.

If there is no health check setting set in the Elastigroup, each batch will wait for the entire grace period to end.

### Deployment Process

While a deployment process is running, no update, such as a capacity change, can be applied to the Elastigroup.

On a high level, the deployment process takes place in the following stages:

1. You define the deployment parameters and trigger the process (either from the Actions menu or as a [scheduled task](elastigroup/features/core-features/scheduling)).
2. For the first batch, Elastigroup launches new (i.e., green) instances in the cluster.
   a. Elastigroup monitors the instances using the configured health check service.
   b. When the new instances are registered as healthy, the old (i.e., blue) instances are scaled down.
3. Elastigroup repeats Step 2 for the next batch and continues until all the batches are deployed.

### System Behavior

- One failed batch is enough to fail the deployment. Be sure to provide an ample grace period for the instances to become healthy.
- Your Elastigroup will not perform new rolls or any scale down activities until the failed roll is completely stopped or the failure is resolved.
- The scale down policy will be suspended until the deployment is finished. In addition, you cannot update the group configuration as long as a deployment is in progress.

## Deploy the Group

To deploy an Elastigroup, do the following:

1. In the Elastigroup Overview page, open the Actions menu and click Deploy.

2. Enter the Batch Size (as a %) and the Grace Period (in seconds), and click Roll.

Once the deployment has started, you will see a banner at the top of the page indicating “Ongoing Deployment”.

### Schedule a Deployment Task

You can also configure a scheduled task that will run a deployment automatically at a time you choose. This enables you to run the deployment at a time that is convenient for you or times less likely to impact your operations.

## View Deployments

To see information about the deployments of a group, go to the Elastigroup Overview page and click the Deployments tab.

### List of Deployments

The list of deployments provides an overview that includes:

- ID: A unique identifier for the deployment.
- Progress: The percent completion of the deployment process.
- Status: Can be In Progress, Failed, Stopped or Completed.
- Created At: Date and time the deployment was started.

### Details

To see a drill-down of the deployment details, click the arrow by the ID. The drill-down includes:

- Deployment ID
- Number of Batches
- Current Batch
- Grace Period
- Blue Instances
- Green Instances
- Start Date and Time
- Health Check
- Status

If you need to see information about the specific instances or the events in the deployment, click View More.

### Instances

The Instance tab shows status and details of each instance in the deployment, including the blue (old) instances and the green (new) instances.

### Events

The Events tab gives you visibility of the specific events as they complete in the deployment.

## Troubleshooting

There are several reasons that a deployment could fail. Some of the more common issues are:

- The grace period was too short.
- A version of your application is problematic (e.g., the codebase or a new AMI).
- If more than 50% of the instances in a specific batch are unhealthy after the grace period, the deployment will fail.

If a deployment fails, the instance remains running for troubleshooting purposes. Some instances in the Elastigroup may have the old configuration, while the rest may have the new configuration. To fix the failed roll, you will need to stop and detach either the old instances or the new onew. You will have the option to decide which instances. Then, update the Elastigroup configuration and deploy again to apply the configuration updates.

Elastigroup will not start new deployments or any scale down activities until the failed deployment is completely stopped or resolved.
