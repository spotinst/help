# Analyze your Costs

When your cloud cluster uses a combination of spot, on-demand, and reserved instances and you have expenses for compute, network, and storage costs, you may find it challenging to understand what you are paying for and how you might better utilize your cloud budget. The Costs tab in Elastigroup enables you to see a clear breakdown of expenses for the cluster, identify trends, and make decisions about your cluster usage going forward.

## Go to the Costs Tab

To view a breakdown of your Elastigroup costs:

1. In the Spot console, go to Elastigroup and click Groups.
2. Click on the name of the Elastigroup and click the Costs tab.

The default timeframe of the cost data is Month to Date, covering from the first of the current month to the current date. You can also view the data over the last 30 days or last 90 days.

## Daily Spend Breakdown

This bar chart shows how much your compute cost was on each day of the time period. Each bar is broken down by spot, on-demand, and reserved instance cost for that day. To see the amounts for a specific day, hover your mouse over the bar.
