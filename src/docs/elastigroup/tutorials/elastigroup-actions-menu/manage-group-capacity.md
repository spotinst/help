# Manage Group Capacity

## Update the Elastigroup Capacity Configuration

The Manage Capacity option in the Elastigroup's Actions menu simplifies the process of updating the Elastigroup Target, Minimum and Maximum configurations.

## Before Updating the Elastigroup Capacity

1. If the group has an unexpected capacity configuration, check for scheduled tasks that may have triggered capacity updates.
2. Note that capacity updates affect the limits that the Elastigroup is able to scale to.

## Updating Elastigroup Capacity

To update the Elastigroup capacity, select the desired Elastigroup in the Elastigroups view. Under the Actions menu select Manage Capacity.
