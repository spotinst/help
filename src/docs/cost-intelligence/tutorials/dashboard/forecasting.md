# Forecasting 

You can leverage LLM intelligence to generate forecast models based on their existing charts within the Cost Intelligence Dashboards.

The Forecasting feature provides this information:
* Confidence upper and lower scores to the forecasts. These scores provide valuable context and indicate the level of confidence in the forecasted values. 
* Additional chart types, specifically multi-series line and box charts based on time. You can generate forecasts for charts that display multiple series of data over time, allowing for more accurate predictions.

All qualifying charts have a Forecasting icon in the top bar
