# Forecasting 

You can leverage LLM intelligence to generate forecast models based on their existing charts within the Cost Intelligence Dashboards. 

All qualifying charts have an icon in the top bar titled Forecasting. Forecasting is currently limited to single-series, time-based charts. 

Click the forecasting icon to open a modal window where you can view the predicted forecast in real time and then export it as a CSV or PNG image.
