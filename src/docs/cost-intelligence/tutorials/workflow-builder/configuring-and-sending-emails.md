## Tokens
You can add tokens to the body of an email to include dynamic and detailed data for your users.

You can use data tokens in emails that were [created in the Cost Intelligence dashboard or Workflows]([cost-intelligence/tutorials/workflow-builder/README)](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/workflow-builder/). In the dashboard, check the metric's name to search for the name/value pair in the token list.

Data and system tokens can be used in the subject line and the message body. 

## Attach a Dashboard Resource 
You can attach dashboards and charts to emails by clicking Insert / Attach. You can include a custom attachment, export entire dashboards, or export individual charts. Each email can be up to 10.5 MB.
