# Administration 

User and account access are managed in Billing Engine and Cost Intelligence Administration pages. On these pages, you can see the users and cloud accounts configured for Spot accounts. 

You can [manage users and accounts](https://docs.spot.io/administration/) in Spot.  

## Users 

Users need to [be created](https://docs.spot.io/administration/users-a/) in the Spot console for Billing Engine and Cost Intelligence. 

## Accounts 

Billing Engine and Cost Intelligence tables list the Spot accounts configured for each product. 

### Onboarded Accounts 

Each product has a tab where you can view and manage the cloud accounts onboarded for each of the products. 

All Billing Engine onboarded accounts are automatically onboarded into Cost Intelligence. You can see them in the Cost Intelligence Dashboards. 

For cloud accounts without inventory data, such as an Azure EA, the inventory and best practice check features are not available.
