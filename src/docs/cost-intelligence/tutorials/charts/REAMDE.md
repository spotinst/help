## Create a Chart

To create a chart: 

1. In the Cost Intelligence console, click **Actions** > **Create**.
2. Click **Add Chart**. 
3. Select a dataset from the left panel.
4. From the right panel, select the type of chart you want to create.
5. From the left panel, drag a value to the Value field at the top of the screen (X axis of chart). 
6. From the left panel, drag a category to the Category field at the top of the screen (Y axis of chart)
7. Enter a name for the chart and an optional description.

9. Click **Publish Dashboard** to save changes that were made to the dashboard. (01:57)

**Note**: Charts belong to the dataset they are created under, allowing them to be easily used across multiple dashboards. This eliminates the need to recreate the charts within each individual dashboard.

## Close a Chart
You can close a chart you created or edited.

* Click the **X** at the top right corner of the chart to close it. The chart will be saved in the last state that was created.
* Click the **X** at the top right corner of the chart builder area to close the builder without saving the chart.

You can change the size of charts inside the chart builder by grabbing and dragging a corner of the panel.

## Delete a Chart 
You can delete a chart that you have created and saved. 

1. In the _Data_ menu on the left panel, click the chart you want to delete.
2. Click the **X** next to a chart name. This will delete the chart from all of the dashboards that use it.
