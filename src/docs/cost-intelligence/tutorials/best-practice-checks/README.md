# Best Practice Checks 

Cloud computing providers present a large, robust offering with a seemingly infinite number of configuration options to tailor your deployment perfectly to your needs. However, the flexibility and sheer number of choices that a cloud provider offers when setting up your services are both a blessing and a curse.  It can be easy to overlook security loopholes, deploy options that aren't the most cost-effective, or miss beneficial features that are hidden within the API.

Our application takes a detailed look at your deployment to ensure your infrastructure is configured properly and highlight areas that may be cause for concern. These checks will focus on 3 key areas: availability, cost, and usage. 

**Availability** 

When items are launched in your deployment, it's important that they are accessible. However, sometimes things can go wrong, such as instances becoming unhealthy or certain data centers becoming unreachable. Cost Intelligence will look at your deployment to not only verify that everything is up and running, but also ensure that your architecture is properly configured to respond when things do go awry. 

**Cost** 

When launching and maintaining an infrastructure, it's easy to lose track of what's out there and what's no longer needed. Cost Intelligence can help with this. It will look for items that exist but aren't being used and highlight those for you. Cost checks will also show you potential cost savings by making RI purchases, optimizing your subscriptions, or leveraging any available discounts, as well as migrating resources to current generation offering types. 

**Usage** 

There are many options within a cloud environment that, though highly recommended, may not be consistently or properly deployed. Cost Intelligence will review your architecture to see whether you are taking advantage of these features, and whether they are being used in the most advantageous way. It will ensure that autoscaling is configured, and configured properly, within your servers. It will ensure that the users in your identity management portals are created according to best practices. That backups are taken automatically and retained for an appropriate amount of time. And that resources are being properly utilized.  

## Check Detail Page 

When you click on a check, you will see all the details related to the check, including a table of specific resources that triggered the check. At the top of the page, there is an info icon that provides a brief description of the check. 

The detail page will contain several columns that are most relevant to the check and the resources in question.
