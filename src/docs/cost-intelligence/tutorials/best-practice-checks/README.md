# Best Practice Checks  

Cloud computing providers present a large number of choices with a large number of configuration options to tailor your deployment to your needs. Best practice checks help you avoid overlooking security loopholes, missing beneficial features that are hidden within the API or deploying options that aren't the most cost-effective.   

View Best Practice Check assessments by account. To view historical assessments, utilize the History feature to view specific assessments.

## Categories  

This application takes a detailed look at your deployment to ensure your infrastructure is configured properly and highlight areas that may be a cause for concern. These checks focus on 3 key areas: availability, cost, and usage.  

**Availability**  

When launching items in your deployment, accessibility is crucial. However, issues can arise, like instances becoming unhealthy or data centers becoming unreachable. Cost Intelligence ensures that your deployment is functioning correctly and that it is properly configured to handle such situations.  

**Cost**    

When managing infrastructure, it's common to overlook unnecessary items. Cost Intelligence helps by identifying unused items for you. It also provides cost checks to suggest cost savings by making RI purchases, optimizing your subscriptions, or leveraging any available discounts. Cost Intelligence also migrates resources to current generation offering types.   

**Usage**    

There are many options within a cloud environment that, though highly recommended, may not be consistently or properly deployed. Cost Intelligence reviews your architecture to see whether you are taking advantage of these features, and whether they are being used in the most advantageous way. It ensures:    

* that autoscaling is configured and configured properly within your servers.  
* that the users in your identity management portals are created according to best practices.   
* backups are done automatically and retained for an appropriate amount of time.   
* that resources are being properly utilized.   

## Check Detail Page  

When you click on a check, you can see the details related to the check, including a table of specific resources that triggered the check. At the top of the page, there is an info icon that provides a brief description of the check.  

The detail page contains several columns that are most relevant to the check and the resources in question.
