# Features

The procedures in this section describe how to maximize your cost intelligence policies, set up dashboards, and ensure that the infrastructure of your deployment is configured properly to reduce costs by utilizing usage data. 

The following list of Cost Intelligence features and terminology includes various tools and functionalities that allow organizations to track, analyze, and optimize their financial performance. 

## Cost Intelligence Policy

The Cost Intelligence [policy](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/cost-intelligence-policy/) enables the collection of information on services and metrics in AWS and Azure infrastructures, providing reporting and analysis capabilities, with additional permissions for premium features and security essentials if enabled.

## Dashboards

Users with Cost Intelligence Admin permissions can manage and create [dashboards](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/dashboard/), including setting the organization's default dashboard, editing existing dashboards, cloning dashboards, uploading CSV files to create datasets, managing datasets, and creating asset groups with defined filters for collective data viewing and management.

## Best Practice Checks

[Best Practice Checks](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/best-practice-checks/) in Cost Intelligence help identify optimization opportunities, beneficial hidden features, and cost-effective deployment options by reviewing critical areas such as availability, cost, and usage, and providing remediation instructions to fix any identified issues, including checking for untagged resources.

## Inventory

Cost Intelligence offers detailed [inventory](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/inventory) reports for AWS and Azure cloud services. These reports allow you to view your infrastructure by service, select specific cloud providers and accounts, and export data to a CSV file. You can also customize columns and sort data.

## Workflow Builder

The Cost Intelligence [Workflow Builder](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/workflow-builder/) allows you to create automated workflows based on data from Cost Intelligence dashboards. These workflows can include sending scheduled emails, generating alerts, updating custom datasets, and utilizing tokens for dynamic data. The Workflow Activity Log provides detailed information about workflow activities, errors, and events.
