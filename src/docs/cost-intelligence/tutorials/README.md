## Dashboards

Users with Cost Intelligence Admin permissions can manage and create [dashboards](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/dashboard/), including setting the organization's default dashboard, editing existing dashboards, cloning dashboards, uploading CSV files to create datasets, managing datasets, and creating asset groups with defined filters for collective data viewing and management.

## Best Practice Checks

[Best Practice Checks](https://docs.spot.io/cost-intelligence/tutorials/best-practice-checks/) in Cost Intelligence help identify optimization opportunities, beneficial hidden features, and cost-effective deployment options by reviewing critical areas such as availability, cost, and usage, and providing remediation instructions to fix any identified issues, including checking for untagged resources.

## Inventory
