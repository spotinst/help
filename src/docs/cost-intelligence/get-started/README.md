# Get Started with Cost Intelligence 

Whether you are a new Spot customer or an existing one, we have a streamlined process to ensure a seamless experience. If you are new to Spot, we recommend following our organization creation process, which will enable you to add your cloud accounts.   

Cost Intelligence currently supports AWS and Azure accounts exclusively. This means you can leverage the power of Cost Intelligence to optimize your spending and make informed decisions regarding your cloud resources. If you have multiple accounts, you can easily switch between them by accessing the account switcher located at the top right of the screen.
