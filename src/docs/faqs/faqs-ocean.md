   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanallocationutilization">AWS, Azure, GCP: What's the difference between allocation and utilization for Ocean right sizing?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

Estimating the proper amount of CPU and memory when assigning resource requests to workloads is a challenge that teams face when designing Kubernetes or ECS clusters. To address this challenge and create even more resource-efficient clusters, Ocean has implemented a right-sizing recommendation mechanism.

Right-sizing recommendations are provided per container and summarized for the entire workload for easy presentation at a high level. Recommendations per container enable you to easily understand exactly which applications require changes in resource requests and implement those changes quickly.

Applying the changes suggested by those notifications helps utilize resources in the cluster in a more precise manner and lowers the chances of cluster issues resulting from under- or over-utilization of resources.

Sometimes, there’s a difference between the number of resources in use in the Spot console and AWS.

Ocean performs scaling according to allocation. There are times when a pod’s request fully utilizes the number of resources allocated. Ocean’s scaling takes this into consideration. This is why a discrepancy may occur. The workload can use fewer resources than the number of resources that were initially allocated or requested.

Ocean’s solution to this mismatch is a feature called [Right Sizing](/ocean/features/right-sizing). The Right Sizing tab shows the discrepancy between the number of resources allocated (Requested) and the number of resources that are currently utilized (Recommended). This can help you make changes to your current resource utilization.

![oceanrightsizing1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/499116be-1d13-45bf-9ca4-fc57d4b3bd3a)

In the Recommendations table, you can see the exact amount of resources to change from the pod’s request.

This can happen if your virtual node group was deleted in Terraform. When you delete a virtual node group in Terraform, the `spotinst_ocean_aws_launch_spec` > `delete_nodes` needs to be manually set to <i>true</i> in the [Terraform resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spotinst/spotinst/latest/docs/resources/ocean_aws_launch_spec#delete_nodes). If it's not set to <i>true</i>, the node will keep running and not be in a virtual node group.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

You can change your volume type to gp3 by:

* Adding a block device mapping for a single virtual node group in the Spot console:

   1. In the Spot console, go to **Ocean** > **Cloud Cluster**s and select the cluster.
   2. On the Virtual Nodes Groups tab, select the virtual node group.
   3. Go to **Advanced** > **Block Device Mapping**.
   4. Add the block device mapping and click **Save**.
   5. [Roll the virtual node group](ocean/features/roll-gen?id=roll-per-node-or-vng) if you want the changes to apply immediately on new nodes.

* Changing the AMI to an AMI with gp3 volume type:

   1. In the Spot console, go to **Ocean** > **Cloud Cluster**s and select the cluster.
   2. On the Virtual Nodes Groups tab, select the virtual node group.
   3. Go to **Advanced** > **Image**.
   4. Select an AMI with gp3.

* Making the [default virtual node group](ocean/features/launch-specifications?id=default-virtual-node-group) gp3 by adding a block device mapping at the cluster level.

   1. Add the block device mapping:

      * In the JSON: select the cluster > **Actions** > **Edit Cluster** > **Review** > **JSON** > **Edit Mode**.
      * Using the [Ocean AWS cluster update API](https://docs.spot.io/api/#tag/Ocean-AWS/operation/OceanAWSClusterUpdate).

      Keep in mind, you cannot use both [block device mapping](ocean/tutorials/manage-virtual-node-groups?id=advanced-parameters) and [root volume size](ocean/tutorials/manage-virtual-node-groups?id=configuration-parameters) at the same time.

      Sample block device mapping:

     ````json
	{
	  "group": {
    	   "compute": {
      	    "launchSpecification": {
             "blockDeviceMappings": [
              {
               "deviceName": "/dev/sda1",
               "ebs": {
                 "deleteOnTermination": true,
                 "volumeSize": 24,
                 "volumeType": "gp2"
               }
              }
             ]
            }
           }
          }
         }
    ````

   2. Make sure to [roll the cluster](ocean/features/roll-gen) to replace the current instance gracefully with the changes.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanodresp">AWS: Why is my on-demand instance utilized as a reserved instance/savings plan?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   When is an on-demand (OD) instance a reserved instance (RI), savings plan (SP), or full-priced on demand?
   
   When launching an on-demand instance, you cannot specifically request it to run as a reserved instance or savings plan.

AWS decides according to:

1. If the market matches a free zonal reserved instance commitment, then the instance is a reserved instance.
2. If the market matches a free regional reserved instance commitment, then the instance is a reserved instance.
3. If the market matches a free EC2 instance savings plan commitment, then the instance is a savings plan.
4. If there is any free compute service plan commitment, then the instance is a savings plan.
5. Otherwise, the instance will run as a full-price on-demand instance.

Throughout the lifetime of an instance, it can change its “price” whenever there’s any change in the commitments utilization rate. For example, if an instance is running as a full price on-demand instance, and another instance that was utilizing a compute savings plan commitment was terminated, the first instance will start utilizing this commitment if its hourly price rate has enough free space under this commitment. It might take a couple of minutes for this change to show, but since the billing is being calculated retroactively, in practice it’s starting to utilize the commitment right away.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanlabel">AWS: Does a cluster roll replace nodes containing pods with the <i>spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down</i> label?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   Yes, a cluster roll will override the <i>spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down</i> label. Nodes containing pods with the <i>spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down</i> label will be replaced during a cluster roll.

Nodes can be replaced during a cluster roll even if the [instance is locked](elastigroup/features/core-features/instance-actions?id=lock-an-instance). Instance lock only protects the instance from autoscaling actions. Cluster roll is a manually triggered action that requires replacing all the cluster’s instances.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanimds">AWS: How can I update the instance metadata (IMDS) in my cluster?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

Instance metadata service (IMDS) is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance or virtual machines. IMDS comes from the cloud providers. The metadata can include instance ID, IP address, security groups, and other configuration details.
Instance metadata service version 2 (IMDSv2) addresses security concerns and vulnerabilities from IMDSv1. IMDSv2 has more security measures to protect against potential exploitation and unauthorized access to instance metadata.

**Scenario 1: Ocean and Elastigroup**

You can define metadata for autoscaling groups in AWS that gets imported when you import the groups from AWS to Spot. You can manually configure them in Spot to use IMDSv2.

1. Follow the [Ocean AWS Cluster Create](https://docs.spot.io/api/#tag/Ocean-AWS/operation/OceanAWSClusterCreate) or [Elastigroup AWS Create](https://docs.spot.io/api/#tag/Elastigroup-AWS/operation/elastigroupAwsCreate) API instructions and add this configuration for the cluster:
   ````json
   "compute": {
    "launchSpecification": {
        "instanceMetadataOptions": {
            "httpTokens": "required",
            "httpPutResponseHopLimit": 12,
            "httpEndpoint": "enabled"
          }
      }
    }
   ````

2. Apply these changes to the currently running instances so the clusters are restarted and have the new definitions:
    * [Deploy an Elastigroup](https://docs.spot.io/elastigroup/tutorials/elastigroup-actions-menu/deploy-or-roll-elastigroup?id=deploy-an-elastigroup)
    * [Roll an Ocean cluster](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/features/roll-gen)

**Scenario 2: Stateful Node**

When a stateful managed node is imported from AWS, Spot creates an image from the snapshot. When an instance is recycled, the metadata configuration is deleted and changes to IMDSv1.

You can use your own AMI and configure IMDSv2 on it. All instances launched after recycling will have IMDSv2 by default.

1. Configure IMDSv2 on your AMI:
    * If you're creating a new AMI, you can add IMDSv2 support using AWS CLI:
     ````
      aws ec2 register-image Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
      --name my-image \
      --root-device-name /dev/xvda \
      --block-device-mappings DeviceName=/dev/xvda,Ebs={SnapshotId=snap-0123456789example} \
      --imds-support v2.0
      ````

    * If you use an existing AMI, you can add IMDSv2 using AWS CLI:
      ````
      aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
      --image-id ami-0123456789example \
      --imds-support v2.0
      ````

2. In the Spot console, [create a stateful node](https://docs.spot.io/managed-instance/getting-started/create-a-new-managed-instance) with the custom AMI.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanebs">AWS: Why is EBS optimization disabled on instances optimized by default?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

[Amazon EBS–optimized](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html) instances use an optimized configuration stack and provide additional, dedicated bandwidth for Amazon EBS I/O.

Instances that are [EBS-optimized by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html#current) are optimized [regardless of the parameter settings](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/2667#issuecomment-352622410). There is no need to enable EBS optimization and no effect if you disable EBS optimization in AWS or in Spot.

If an instance type isn’t [EBS-optimized by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html#current), you can enable optimization:

1. In the Spot console, go to the Ocean cluster or Elastigroup.
2. Click **Compute** > **launchSpecification**.
3. Set **ebsOptimized** to <i>true</i>.

If you’re getting this message:

````
Can't Spin Spot Instances: Message: The tag policy does not allow the specified value for the following tag key: 'XXX'.
````

It means a tag defined in your Elastigroup or cluster doesn’t comply with AWS’s tag policy.

1. In the Spot console, go to:

   * **Elastigroup** > **Groups** > click on the Elastigroup > **Log**.
   * **Ocean** > **Cloud Clusters** > click on the cluster > **Log**.

2. Identify the problematic tag keys/values.

3. Review [AWS’s tag policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies.html) and how to [set up tag policies](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/aws-launches-tag-policies/).

4. In the Spot console, update the tag keys/values:

   * **Elastigroup** > **Groups** > click on the Elastigroup > **Actions** > **Edit Configuration** > **Compute** > **Advanced Settings**.
   * **Ocean** > **Cloud Clusters** > click on the cluster > **Actions** > **Edit Cluster** > **Compute**.

The instance will be launched when the tags in Spot clusters/groups comply with the tag policy defined in AWS.

These messages could be related to [service control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) (SCP). Keep in mind, Spot doesn’t get SCP information from AWS, so doesn’t know which instance types AWS blocks because of the SCP restrictions. As a result, Spot cannot launch a new instance of a different type.

1. You need to [identify the reason for the error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_DecodeAuthorizationMessage.html) in AWS.
2. In the Spot console, update the instance types:

   * [Ocean](ocean/tips-and-best-practices/manage-machine-types?id=opt-out-of-machine-types)

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

For scale-up events, Ocean scales up as quickly as possible.

For scale-down events, cooldown is the number of seconds that Ocean waits after the end of a scaling action before starting another scaling action. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

Cooldown is set at the cluster level and is applied across all virtual node groups in the cluster. So if a node of one virtual node group is scaled down, then Ocean waits for the cooldown time to pass before scaling down another node in a virtual node group.

You can set the cooldown period:

* In the Spot console, go to **Ocean** > **Cloud Clusters** > select the cluster > **Actions** > **Edit Cluster** > **Review** > **JSON** > **Edit Mode**.
* Using the APIs:

   * [Ocean AWS cluster update](https://docs.spot.io/api/#tag/Ocean-AWS/operation/OceanAWSClusterUpdate)

Ocean is aware of a pending pod and is spinning up an instance. Based on your current instance market, Ocean chooses the instance type in a particular availability zone and attempts to scale up. If it fails due to a lack of capacity, the error message is shown in the console logs.

You can solve this by:
* Having many instance types so Ocean can choose the best available markets.

It means that your strategy cannot be fixed and your spot instances cannot be reverted to spot instances. This is because you have standalone tasks in the instances, and the group's configuration can't stop standalone tasks. The autoscaler cannot scale down these instances.

Update the cluster [in the API](https://docs.spot.io/api/#tag/Ocean-ECS/operation/OceanECSClusterUpdate) or in the cluster's JSON file to include `"shouldScaleDownNonServiceTasks": true`.

Your container instance must be registered with an ECS cluster. If the container instance isn't registered, its status is <i>unhealthy</i>. Registering a container instance with an ECS cluster means you are telling the ECS service that a specific EC2 instance is available to run containers. It also sends information to ECS about the EC2 instance, such as its IP address, the docker daemon endpoint.

If your container is unregistered, you should make sure:

* **User Data**
  
  1. Go to the cluster in the Spot console and click **Actions** > **Edit Configuration** > **Compute**.
  2. Add this script to **User Data**, using your cluster name.

       ````

* **AMI**

  ECS is optimized and Agent (similar to the controller in Kubernetes) is configured in the AMI.
  
* **Security group and specific ports**
  * **Port 22 (SSH)** is required if you want to connect to your container instances using Secure Shell (SSH) for troubleshooting or maintenance.
    It is not directly related to ECS cluster registration, but it's commonly included for administrative access to the instances.
  * **Port 2375 (TCP)** is used for the ECS container agent to communicate with the ECS control plane. It allows the agent to register the container instance with the cluster, send heartbeats, and receive instructions for task placement and management.
  * **Port 2376 (TCP)** is used for secure communication between the ECS container agent and the ECS control plane. It enables encrypted communication and is recommended for improved security when managing your ECS cluster.

* **IAM role**

  Configure an instance profile with relevant permissions.

   A non-service task is a standalone task that isn't part of a service. It's typically used for batch processing or one-time jobs rather than continuous, long-running services.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="hostportunderutilized">ECS: Can hostPort cause underutilized nodes?</summary>

<div style="padding-left:16px">

If a node only has one task running, then it causes the node to be underutilized. Underutilized nodes should be bin-packed together if there are no constraints in the task/service definition.

Example service:

````json
"placementConstraints": [],
   "placementStrategy": [],
````

The task definition doesn't have constraints to spread tasks across nodes.

````json
"placementConstraints": [
  {
  "type": "memberOf",
  "expression": "attribute:nd.type == default"
  }
  ],
````

Check the **portMappings: hostPort** value in the task/service defintion.

Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instances to send or receive traffic. This configuration can be found in the task definition. The hostPort value in port mapping is normally left blank or set to 0.

Example:
````json
      "portMappings": [
            {
               "protocol": "tcp",
               "hostPort": 0,
               "containerPort": 443
````

However, if the hostPort value equals the containerPort value, then each task needs its own container. Any pending tasks trigger a scale-up, and the number of launched instances is equal to the number of pending tasks. This leads to underutilized instances and higher costs.

You can have multiple containers defined in a single task definition. Check all the <i>portMappings</i> configurations for each container in the [task definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PortMapping.html).

   You can safely disconnect Ocean from an existing EKS Cluster:

1. Increase the number of instances in the ASG attached to the EKS cluster. This way, the pods that run on the nodes managed by Spot will be able to reschedule on the new instances and avoid downtime.
2. In the Spot console, go to **Ocean** > **Cloud Clusters**, and select the cluster.
3. Click **Actions** > **Edit Cluster**.
4. On the Review tab, click **JSON** > **Edit Mode**.
5. Change **capacity** > **Minimum**, **Maximum**, and **Target** to <i>0</i>.

   The instances managed by Ocean will be detached and the pods will be rescheduled on the new instances launched by AWS ASG.
6. In the Spot console, go to **Ocean** > **Cloud Clusters**, and select the cluster.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

Your DaemonSet pods are only scheduled on one specific virtual node group, not on all the nodes in a virtual node group in cluster.

This can happen if you use taints on your pods in virtual node groups. You can either use taints on all your pods, or not use taints. You can't mix pods with taints and without taints.

Update your tolerances in the DaemonSet YAML so you can schedule DaemonSet pods on the nodes in virtual node groups with taints.

For example, you can update your [DaemonSet pod YAML](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) to include:

````json
   spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: dedicated

<div style="padding-left:16px">

Kubernetes nodes in the cluster have <i>Unhealthy</i> status—the node has a <i>Node Name</i> but the Kubernetes status is <i>Unhealthy</i>.

You can debug unhealthy Kubernetes nodes:
* Check the nodes' status by running this command in CLI: `kubectl get nodes`
   Look for nodes in a <i>NotReady</i> or <i>Unknown</i> state. This indicates that the nodes are unhealthy or experiencing issues.
* Get detailed information about the problematic nodes by running the `kubectl describe` command: `kubectl describe node <node-name>`.
   Look for any error messages or warnings that can help identify the problem. Pay attention to resource allocation issues, network connectivity problems, or other relevant information.
* Verify the health of cluster components such as the kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime (for example, Docker, containerd). Check your local logs and the status of these components to identify any errors or issues.
* Examine the resource utilization of your nodes, including CPU, memory, and disk usage. High resource utilization can lead to node instability or unresponsiveness. Use tools like Prometheus or Grafana to monitor resource metrics.
* Ensure that network connectivity is properly configured and functioning between the Kubernetes control plane and the nodes. Verify that nodes can reach each other and communicate with external services.
* Use the `kubectl get events` command to check for cluster-level events that might provide insights into the node health issues. Events often contain helpful information about the state of your cluster and its components.
* Examine the logs of individual pods running on the problematic nodes. Logs can provide clues about any application-specific issues or errors that might be impacting node health. Use the `kubectl logs` command to retrieve pod logs.
* Verify that the node configurations (for example, kubelet configuration, network settings) are correct and aligned with the cluster requirements.
* Ensure that the container runtime (such as Docker, containerd) is properly installed and functioning on the nodes. Check the runtime logs for any errors or warnings.
* If you think that a specific component is causing the node health issues, consider updating or reinstalling that component to resolve any known bugs or conflicts.

<div style="padding-left:16px">

When you have a [workload migration](ocean/tutorials/migrate-workload) in progress, there may be unhealthy instances. They are not replaced until after the migration finishes. This happens because Ocean’s scaler does not handle replacements in the cluster during workload migration.

If there is no active migration, after the configured unhealthy duration ends (the default is 120 seconds), the unhealthy instances are terminated and immediately replaced with new ones.

   Ocean doesn't actually have a horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) policy. The HPA is essentially operating on the Kubernetes side so Ocean itself doesn't have an HPA.

The cluster autoscaler only takes care of provisioning the required number of nodes.

Essentially, if the load increases on your cluster, then Kubernetes will create more replicas, and Ocean will launch nodes for the new pods. Kubernetes HPA will create pods and Ocean will launch new nodes for pods to be scheduled.

<div style="padding-left:16px">

<a href="https://ec2spotworkshops.com/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/070_selfmanagednodegroupswithspot/deployhandler.html">AWS node termination handler</a> is a DaemonSet pod that is deployed on each spot instance. It detects the instance termination notification signal so that there will be a graceful termination of any pod running on that node, drain from load balancers, and redeploy applications elsewhere in the cluster.

AWS node termination handler makes sure that the Kubernetes control plane responds as it should to events that can cause EC2 instances to become unavailable. Some reasons EC2 instances may become unavailable include:
* EC2 maintenance events
* EC2 spot interruptions
* ASG scale-in
* ASG AZ rebalance
* EC2 instance termination using the API or Console

If not handled, the application code may not stop gracefully, take longer to recover full availability, or accidentally schedule work to nodes going down.

The workflow of the node termination handler DaemonSet is:
1. Identify that a spot instance is being reclaimed.
2. Use the 2-minute notification window to prepare the node for graceful termination.
3. Taint the node and cordon it off to prevent new pods from being placed.
4. Drain connections on the running pods.
5. Replace the pods on the remaining nodes to maintain the desired capacity.

Ocean does not conflict with aws-node-termination-handler. It is possible to install it, but using aws-node-termination-handler is not required. Ocean continuously analyzes how your containers use infrastructure, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability.
Ocean ensures that the cluster resources are utilized and scales down underutilized nodes to optimize maximal cost.

When [importing EKS clusters to Ocean](ocean/getting-started/eks/join-an-existing-cluster) in the Spot console, some of your clusters may not show in the list you can import from. Make sure:

* The EKS cluster is in the region you’re trying to import from.
* You have the [correct permissions](ocean/getting-started/eks/join-an-existing-cluster?id=add-required-permissions) and the most [current Spot policy](administration/api/spot-policy-in-aws).
* The Kubernetes cluster has an EKS version that is [supported by Amazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html). Spot supports an EKS version two months after the Amazon [EKS release date](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar). A version is considered deprecated for Spot when Amazon [ends standard support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar). A version is considered retired for Spot when Amazon [ends extended support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar).

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

You may run into a case where Ocean doesn’t automatically launch a node after the [shutdown hours](ocean/features/running-hours) end. You then need to manually launch a node and reinstall the controller pod after the shutdown hours.

This can happen because Ocean automatically scales down the entire cluster to 0 when the period of running time ends. During the off time, all nodes are down, and the Ocean controller is down and does not report information to the autoscaler.

When the off time ends, Ocean starts a single node from a virtual node group without taints. If all virtual node groups have taints, Ocean starts a node from the default virtual node group unless useAsTemplateOnly is defined, in which case no node is started.

You need to make sure the controller is running, possibly on a node that Ocean does not manage. Once the node launches and is registered to the Kubernetes cluster, the Ocean controller is scheduled.

You can force nodes to scale up from a dedicated virtual node group using custom [taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) or custom [nodeSelector labels](ocean/features/labels-and-taints).

Keep in mind, if you add taints or labels on the pod, you need to add matching labels and toleration on the virtual node group in both [Node Selection and in the User Data (startup script)](ocean/tutorials/manage-virtual-node-groups?id=node-selection-parameters).

Each node on Kubernetes has a [different number of elastic network interfaces (ENI) available](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/blob/master/misc/eni-max-pods.txt). For example, M5.Large can only have 29+2*31 ENIs.

You can create a script to dynamically calculate the `--max-pods` value based on the instance type and CNI version. For example:

````
CNI_VERSION=<such as 1.11.4-eksbuild.1> MAX_PODS=$(/etc/eks/max-pods-calculator.sh --instance-type-from-imds --cni-version $CNI_VERSION)
````

`--instance-type-from-imds` gets the instance type from the instance metadata service (IMDS).

`--cni-version $CNI_VERSION` specifies the CNI version.

If you don’t define a value for `--max-pods` in the user data startup script for a virtual node group, the default AWS value is <i>110</i>.

Defining a static value for `--max-pods` in the user data startup script for a virtual node group can cause overutilization and underutilization issues.

In GKE, regional clusters replicate the cluster’s control plane and nodes in the region's zones. Using multiple regions and zones helps protect against unexpected failures. Workloads can be redirected to nodes in different zones.

In Spot, when you import a regional cluster, the cluster is <b>not</b> integrated with its existing node pools. The instances are registered to the cluster. Spot does <b>not</b> replicate the nodes in all the zones. It acts as a zonal cluster.

Keep in mind:

* The control planes are managed in GKE and are replicated when a regional cluster is selected. This gives you high reliability in the control planes.
* Ocean autoscaler chooses the best markets available for the pending pods. Ocean quickly launches instances in a different zone if there's a zonal outage.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

[Draining timeout](ocean/features/scaling-kubernetes?id=draining-timeout-per-virtual-node-group) (drainingTimeout) is defined in Ocean. It’s how long Ocean waits for the draining process to end before terminating an instance. The default is 300 seconds.

[Termination grace period](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination) (terminationGracePeriodSeconds) is defined in Kubernetes. It’s how long Kubernetes waits before terminating the pod. The default is 30 seconds.

You can use Ocean’s draining timeout to make sure the node isn’t terminated before the pod’s application finishes draining. This is helpful if you have applications in pods that need a specific amount of time to gracefully shut down.

If you have a pod that needs time to gracefully shut down, define a terminationGracePeriodSeconds in the pod. In Ocean, set a draining timeout that is greater than or equal to the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds time. This way, the node will not terminate before the application in the pod gracefully shuts down.

For example, if you have a 600 second terminationGracePeriodSeconds, make sure your draining timeout in Ocean is more than 600 seconds.

   When the `useAsTemplateOnly` parameter is <i>true</i>, you cannot edit the target capacity in the Ocean cluster configuration.
   
Keep in mind that it may not be necessary to increase the target capacity because Ocean automatically scales instances up and down as needed.

1. In the Spot console, go to **Ocean** > **Cloud Clusters**, and select the cluster.
2. Click **Actions** > **Edit**.
3. On the Review tab, click **JSON** > **Edit Mode**.
4. Go to **Compute** > **launchSpecification**.
5. Change the <b>useAsTemplateOnly</b> parameter to <i>false</i>.

This will let you manually increase the target of the cluster and the nodes will launch in the default virtual node group.

With the Version 2 Ocean Controller, Spot gets reports for any custom resource you gave it access to through the controller cluster role.

   You can use a programmatic token for creating Ocean cluster controllers. The benefit of programmatic tokens is they aren't linked to a specific user. If the user is deleted, it doesn't affect the Ocean controller. This helps prevent interruptions and heartbeat issues.

   At minimum, the token must have **account viewer** [permissions](/administration/policies/). Viewer permission is the only permission required for a cluster controller to operate. Cluster controllers don't manage resources in Ocean, the autoscaler does. If you want this same programmatic user to manage other resources in your cluster, additional permission policies are required.

For a network client, only the **account viewer** permission is required for the client to operate.

Ocean stops trying to scale up this pod to prevent infinite scaling.

This can happen if:

* Ocean launches instances for the pending pod but they don’t fully register to the Kubernetes cluster because the pod has no node to schedule.
* You’re using AWS ebs-csi-driver PV/PVC. It’s possible that the [ebs-csi-node](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html) DaemonSet pods are not running on the nodes. This can happen if the DaemonSet object is having issues, the DaemonSet pods are not running, or if taints on a custom virtual node group are stopping the DaemonSet pods from being scheduled on the node. If you’re using DaemonSet, then the DaemonSet pods must run on every node if a pending pod has a PVC.
* You’re using GPU nodes. The [Nvidia GPU DaemonSet](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) is required to run on every GPU node for the nodes to expose their GPU resources. If a pending node is requesting GPU, then Ocean launches a GPU instance. You need to make sure the nodes are exposing the GPU resources. Typically, you do this with the Nvidia GPU DaemonSet. If the DaemonSet has issues, then the pod may not be scheduled on the node because the node won’t be exposing the GPU.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

You can restrict specific pods from scaling down by configuring Ocean and Kubernetes. The instance will be replaced only if:
* It goes into an unhealthy state.
* Forced by a cloud provider interruption.

There are two options for restricting pods from scaling down:
* Kubernetes deployments/pods: spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down: true

  Use the `spotinst.io/restrict-scale-down` label set to <i>true</i> to block proactive scaling down for more efficient bin packing. This will leave the instance running as long as possible. It gets defined as a label in the pod's configuration. See [restrict scale down](ocean/features/labels-and-taints?id=spotinstiorestrict-scale-down).

* Virtual node group (VNG): restrict scale down (only available for AWS, ECS, and GKE)

  You can configure [Restrict Scale Down](ocean/features/vngs/attributes-and-actions-per-vng) at the VNG level so the nodes and pods within the VNG are not replaced or scaled down due to the auto scaler resource optimization. Create a VNG, go to the Advanced tab, then select **Restrict Scale Down**.

* **Filtering**: list of filters. The instance types that match with all filters make up the Ocean's whitelist parameter. Filtering cannot be used with allow or block lists.

You can allow, [block](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/tips-and-best-practices/manage-machine-types?id=opt-out-of-machine-types), or [filter](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/tips-and-best-practices/manage-machine-types?id=select-instance-types-with-advanced-filters) instance types in the cluster configuration in <i>compute: instanceTypes</i> in the cluster’s JSON or using an API.

Cost Analysis in the Ocean Dashboard can show an unusually high cost for yesterday.

![oceancostanalysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96cbe1c7-fa63-4df1-89bb-18154e9778cb)

If you look at the same day a few days later, the cost will be similar to the other days.

![oceancostanalysis2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a11a3a9-a2b1-405a-b274-c2a5370bff43)

Spot's Cost Analysis reviews the cost data after one day. For instance, if today is August 20, the cost analysis data will be finalized only on August 21.

Initially, the costs are compared with the on demand value of the instance types, followed by the Spot value. Afterwards, the costs are compared with reserved instances and saving plans. So, if the you have reserved instances and saving plans configured, the cost gap from the previous day can be higher.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="oceanvmarch">AKS: Can I create VMs with specific architecture in Ocean AKS?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

You may want to run workloads (pods) on VMs with a specified architecture.

For Ocean clusters (AWS), you can use an AMI with the required architecture. Update the AMI in the cluster or virtual node group (VNG) configuration to make sure the instances are launched according to the architecture specified in the AMI.

However, it’s not possible to do with Ocean AKS clusters because you cannot choose a particular image to run VMs when you create an AKS cluster.

1. Create a new virtual node group in the Ocean AKS cluster and configure it manually or import the configuration of a node pool.
2. Add vmSizes to the virtual node group JSON file.

    ````json
	   "vmSizes": {
        "filters": {
            "architectures": [
                 "x86_64"
            ],
            "series": []
                }
    }
    ````
   
   * <b>Architectures</b> is a list of strings, and the values can be a combination of <i>x86_64</i> (includes both <i>intel64</i> and <i>amd64</i>), <i>intel64</i>, <i>amd64</i>, and <i>arm64</i>.

   * Add <b>series</b> with the VM series for the particular architecture.
     For example, run VMs with <i>arm64</i> and launch the VMs with <i>Dps_V5</i> as the series.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

If you have virtual node groups with Spot % set to 100 or Fallback to Regular set to off, you can still have on-demand nodes running.

This can happen if you have nodes in a [kube-system namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/core-aks-concepts#namespaces). Kube-system pods are created by the Kubernetes system and are required to make the cluster work.

AKS only launches spot nodes if the admission controller is enabled and Spot tolerations are injected into the pods.

If there is a stage failure when a job runs in Ocean Spark, there’s a [retry mechanism](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.2/configuration.html#:~:text=2.0.3-,spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts,-4). You can change the number of retries for a stage:

1. In the Spot console, go to **Ocean for Spark** > **Configuration Templates**.
2. Select the configuration template of the application you need to change.
3. Add `spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts` with the number of retries.
