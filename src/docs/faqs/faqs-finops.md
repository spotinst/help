If youâ€™re using StackSets, the [template](cost-intelligence/get-started/connect-aws-stacksets?id=stacksets-template) includes the RenamedSpotAccountByAlias parameter. Your AWS account must have an [alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console-account-alias.html) (billing name) or you will get this error when connecting your Spot account with AWS:

![faq-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c19d832-8077-472a-90dc-08a4903d409e)

Review the [Cost Intelligence Policy](cost-intelligence/tutorials/cost-intelligence-policy/) documentation and ensure the Cloud Formation stack providing the ARN has not been changed and the permissions have not changed. Additionally, ensure no AWS Service Control Policies restrict access.

![faq-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a972653-ed6c-4b82-954d-c19ca17f4d96) 

Review the [Cost Intelligence Policy](cost-intelligence/tutorials/cost-intelligence-policy/) documentation and ensure the permissions have not changed and that the required permissions are not missing. Additionally, ensure no AWS Service Control Policies restrict access. If nothing has changed, it is possible something else is blocking access (example: resource-level access controls) to the listed services for that account.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecosavings">How are savings calculated when I purchase reserved instances?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   Eco gathers data about all of your instances before you are using reserved instances. Savings are calculated each month. This means that you are not charged at the purchasing moment, but for each month separately. The calculation of each purchase is multiplied by the number of instances. For example, Eco purchases one reserved instance at a price of $24 for a duration of one year (amounting to $2 per month). Running an on-demand instance would cost $3 per month. Therefore, Eco saves you $1 per month, and you are charged based on $1 savings each month.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecospot">Does Eco also recommend Spot instances in the projected savings?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   Eco is a tool for management and optimization of commitment discounts (reservations and savings plans). The projected savings by using Eco relate to commitments. You can use Eco for managing commitments in your organization, while using Elastigroup or Ocean to optimize the combined use of Spot and reserved instances in the workload.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   Eco charges only for the reserved instances that have a start date after Eco started.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecoridiscounts">How does ECO consider reserved instance volume discounts?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   Reserved instance volume discounts drive the cost of reservations down. When Eco makes a large reserved instance purchase which generates the reserved instance volume discount, it is by design. Eco includes the cost reductions in the net savings calculations, which may impact your Eco fee.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecolease">What does the reservation end date mean for renewals?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

When a reservation expires, Eco first makes sure a renewal is the right course of action. If so, expired coverage is replaced with the best commitment to provide a blend of flexibility and savings. When an expiration is renewed, a new lease ID is created. Depending on the situation, an expired reservation may be renewed under different parameters, so do not be concerned if you do not see an exact match.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecopolicy">AWS: Is there a best practice template for limiting a policy?</summary>

 <div style="padding-left:16px">

You can use the [AWS restricted Eco policy](https://github.com/spotinst/spotinst-examples/blob/master/Policies/AWS/Spot-AWS-Eco-Restricted-Full-Permission.json).

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecosellfee">AWS: Does the pricing for Eco include the AWS charge for selling reserved instances in the marketplace?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   If there is a fee for selling on the marketplace, you pay AWS based on the current AWS selling fee. Eco pricing is based on the actual savings you achieve.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecoconvri">AWS: If I have convertible AWS reserved instances, does the savings recommendation include the savings by exchanging these?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   Yes. Eco is not able to sell convertible reserved instances. It can only replace them with other reserved instances under AWS constraints. Therefore, Eco suggests how to manage your convertibles. Also, Eco may purchase convertibles for you.

   <summary markdown="span" style="color:#7632FE; font-weight:600" id="ecos3">AWS: Why does Eco need to sync my S3 bucket instead of just reading it?</summary>

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

Eco [syncs your S3 bucket](eco/tutorials/eco-policy/?id=s3) to Spot instead of reading the data each time from your S3 bucket. This improves response time and reduces your costs. Also, if you delete your S3 bucket, then Spot still has the historical data saved.

  <div style="padding-left:16px">

   Review the [Getting Started documentation](eco/getting-started/connect-your-aws-account) for Eco and compare it to your management account resources. Make sure the CloudFormation stack providing the ARN has not been changed. Additionally, make sure no AWS Service Control Policies restrict access.
