# Spot Connect Overview

Spot Connect is a comprehensive cloud orchestration, automation and response platform that unifies case management, automation, real-time collaboration and incident remediation to serve cloud engineering teams across the incident lifecycle.

It orchestrates across hundreds of cloud products to help your cloud engineering and increase team productivity. It assists on-call teams in standardizing and automating processes for faster response times.

Spot Connect's unique incident response approach combines the power of integrations across the cloud product stack. It is a single platform for end-to-end incident lifecycle management.

Key features of the service include:  

* Integrations - Integrations are the building blocks of workflows and come from a wide range of tools like metrics, monitoring, logging, CI/CD, communication, and cloud remediation services.  
They bring all critical data into one platform. Each integration exposes a set of actions that can be used to create a workflow. After configuring the API credentials and authorizing the integration, users can leverage the specific integration actions.

* Workflow Builder- A visual and intuitive interface that makes automated workflow creation as easy as drag and drop. Drop the actions you want to perform on the canvas, connect the steps and run the workflow.

* Workflow Automation- Using the workflow builder, users can create a workflow to start a series of activities in a particular order. The builder takes an often manual, tedious task and converts it to a primarily automated one. Workflows can run automatically via third-party applications that support event notification via a webhook.

* Scheduler- Allows starting workflows manually or according to a particular schedule, such as every Monday at 8 AM or every 15 minutes.

* Execution History- Audit log of each workflow execution, including detailed input and output data of each step in the workflow.

Spot Connect helps you easily build, run, manage, and analyze workflows to accelerate, optimize and automate cloud operations infrastructures. In addition, Spot Connect allows users to deploy Spot by NetApp services rapidly and reliably, as well as manage these services within their existing cloud environments. This could be for onboarding, incident response, large-scale configuration change, or day-to-day management.  

In addition, Spot Connect integrates third-party applications as well as manage Spot resources via our backend API but don’t have the in-house resources or expertise to configure or maintain this.

Spot Connect also allows users to optimize and automate public cloud operations to essentially deploy and automate the management of a large number of applications on the public cloud.
