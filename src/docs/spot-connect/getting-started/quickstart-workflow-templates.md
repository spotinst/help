# QuickStart- Workflow Templates

Template workflows in Spot Connect help you navigate to a specific workflow easily.

* Each workflow represents a use case that could be your starting point.

* Sample workflows can be used as templates. Duplicate them and enhance them to suit your needs.

* Workflows include a combination of integration actions, helper functions, and conditional nodes that could also be used for educational purposes.
