9. Verify the PolicySelection input field.
10. You can specify a custom AWS Security Policy for the AWS account. If you already have a policy, copy and paste the ARN.  

For non-critical test accounts, the PowerUserAccess managed policy is set by default. 	This unlocks the full functionality of the Spot Connect platform.

* The Spot Connect Account ID and External ID fields are automatically entered and can be left in their default state.
* AWS CloudFormation may create IAM resources.

11. Click Create stack.  
12. Wait for the stack creation to complete. When it is complete, select the output tab and copy the value of the AssumeRoleArn Key.
13. Go back to the Spot Connect console and click **Next**.  
14. Paste the value of the AssumeRoleArn copied from the output of the stack and click **Add Account**.
