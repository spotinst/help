<img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-4.png" width="500" height="500" />

### API Key

API keys are unique to a Spot Organization. The webhook requires an API key to trigger a workflow and send the webhook body payload to the workflow.

1. In the left main menu, click **Connect** and **Integrations**. Scroll down to Resources.  
2. Click API keys and click **Add New**.
3. Enter an API Key Name and click **Save**.

## Create the Workflow

Create a workflow using the Spot Elastigroup AWS node.

1. In the left main menu, click **Connect** and **Workflows**.
2. Click **New Workflow**.
3. Enter a suitable workflow name. **Workflow names cannot start with “aws”, “amazon”, or “amz”**.
4. Select the **Generic Webhook** trigger type. This enables you to automatically trigger the workflow from any third-party application that supports webhook notifications.
5. Click **Create Workflow**.

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-5.png" />

6. In the left panel, click the settings icon.

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-6.png" />

7. In the Description field, enter a workflow description. A workflow description is required to save and run the workflow.

### Configure the Trigger Node

1. Click the Generic Webhook trigger node.

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-9.png" />

2. From the Webhook API Key Name dropdown menu, select the API Key created above. The webhook URL and required API Key is provided.

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-10.png" />

3. The API key can be added as a Header or Query Parameter, which is embedded in the URL for usage with AWS SNS Topics.

    > **Note**:
    >
    > - The workflow cannot be saved with the trigger node configured and requires at least one additional node added.
    > 
    > - Since the Generic Webhook trigger is configured, Spot Connect is unaware of which third-party application sends the webhook payload. Therefore, the Output of the trigger node does not show the JSON Schema of the webhook. However, his can be copied by following the steps listed [here](spot-connect/get-to-know/create-first-workflow-spot?id=workflow-execution-alert-body).

#### Extract the Elastigroup ID from the Webhook JSON Formatted Alert Body

The JSONPath node provides another way to extract information from a node's output. This workflow is used as a placeholder to save the workflow and verify the webhook body payload after automatically executing the workflow with a webhook trigger.

1. Click + on the left panel and click **Core**.
2. Drag and drop the JSONPath node onto the canvas.
3. JSONPath node extracts values from keys in JSON arrays and objects.
4. Manually connect the trigger node with the JSONPath node.
5. Change the name of the node to a descriptive name. For example: Elastigroup_ID.
6. In the center panel, select the JSONPath node in the node. The JSONPath expression is an expression language to filter JSON Data. The JSONPath window opens.  

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-11.png" />

7. In the JSON Inputs, select the Trigger node from the dropdown menu.  

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-12.png" />

8. In the Previous Step Output field, select **output_json**.
9. In the JSON Path Expression, set the path as **$.Account_ID**. The following output is displayed:  

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-13.png" />

   This extracts the value from the Account_ID key provided in the webhook body payload.

10. Click **Save Workflow** to save the new workflow version.

## Workflow Execution Alert Body

Set the workflow execution alert body as the output schema for the generic trigger node.

The trigger node output JSON schema is essential for setting values from previous steps in the next nodes in line. The generic webhook trigger node does not provide a JSON schema by default. The output schema can be updated with the alert workflow execution alert body (webhook body).

To update the output schema of the trigger node, complete the following steps:

* Verify the workflow is saved
* Execute the workflow via the third-party application webhook notification. If you know the webhook JSON formatted payload, you can also use Postman while building your workflow.

1. Select **Executions**.
2. Select the workflow.
3. Select the **Alert Body** tab.
4. Click **Use as the output schema**.
5. Open the Workflow builder.
6. Select the generic webhook trigger node.
7. Select the Output tab in the configuration panel.
8. Click **View Outputs**.

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-14.png" />

   The JSON schema is provided for the webhook body from your third-party application.

9. Delete the JSONPath node. This is not required in this example workflow.
10. Save the new workflow version.

## Get the Friendly Name of Elastigroup using the Spot API

The webhook body payload only provides the Elastigroup ID, but we would like to give the familiar name of Elastigroup in the Slack message. Retrieve the Elastigroup configuration details by using the List Elastigroup API call.

1. Click + on the left panel and click **Spot by Netapp**.
2. Drag and drop the **Spot Elastigroup AWS** node onto the canvas.
3. Manually connect the Generic Webhook trigger node to the new Spot Elastigroup AWS node.
4. In the right panel, click the **Input** tab to configure the Spot Elastigroup AWS node.
5. Select the Spot Instance name (API programmatic token).
6. Select the Spot Account. The Spot Accounts available for selection are based on the Spot token selected in the previous step.
7. Select the Spot Operation and select [List Elastigroup](https://docs.spot.io/api/#operation/elastigroupAwsListElastigroup). The required and optional inputs are displayed.

   <img src="/spot-connect/_media/create-wrkflw-spot-15.png" />
