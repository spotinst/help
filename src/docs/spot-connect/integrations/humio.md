# Humio

The integration between Humio and Spot Connect provides users with the ability to automate and streamline cloud log management. 

Humio is powerful and extremely useful for system administrators. It provides a fast, flexible platform for logs and server metrics. With Humio Cloud, your log entries and other metrics are sent to your own private, secure repository. After that, use the Humio interface to analyze your data and to create alerts to let you know when events occur, or parameters are exceeded. 

The alerts can be later ingested by Spot Connect with this integration and relevant information can be retrieved actively in the middle of any investigation from Spot Connect. 

The integration between Spot Connect and Humio enables you to: 

* Trigger a workflow in Spot Connect, when a specific Humio Alert goes into the state of ALERT. 
* Search logs/metrics stored in Humio.
