# Container

Use the Container node for running a script that is packaged in a container to remediate an incident. To do so, you need to create an ECR that contains a docker image.  

Many scripts (e.g., Bash, Python scripts) and code in containers are used when remediating problems in the infrastructure. This integration supports executing these scripts in Spotâ€™s workflows and connects these scripts to other services available in Spot Connect.  

**Note**: The container images used in this action node need to be set up according to https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/ .  

Additionally, the target account role needs to have its Trust Relationships updated to allow access to the AWS lambda service, and an updated Condition clause as shown.   

The Container integration enables you to:  

* Configure a container registry.  
* Pick a Docker image and version that is available in the registry.  
* Pass any input to the Docker image in a text box. The input is directly passed as input when running the container.  
* Enter resource requirements for the container  
* CPU (specified in CPU units).   
* MEM (specified in MB)
