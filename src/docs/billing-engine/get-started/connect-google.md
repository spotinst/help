# Connect Google Cloud Billing Account

This topic describes how to connect your Google Cloud Billing Account to Billing Engine. 

## Prerequisites 

* Permissions to create Service Accounts. 
* **Billing Account Administrator** and **BigQuery User** permissions. These should be linked to a Google project containing a BigQuery dataset that Billing Engine needs to read your Google Cloud Billing data.

## Step 1: Log in to your Google Cloud Account 

1. In the Spot console, click **Billing Engine** > **Administration**. Enter an account name and click **Create Account**.
2. Select **Google Cloud** > **FinOps Products** > **Next**. 
3. Click **Log in to your Google Cloud Account** and log in.  

## Step 2: Create a Service Account 

Create a service account for Spot and grant it the Viewer role. This allows Spot to access and analyze cost and usage data in your Google Cloud account.

1. In the Spot console, copy the service account name, for example spotinst-role-79885e98. 
2. In the Google Cloud console, select the project you are connecting to and [create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create). 
3. Paste the name you copied from the Spot console into **Service Account Name**. The service account ID is automatically created. Click **CREATE**. 
4. In [Service Account Permissions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role), select **Role:** _Viewer_. Click **DONE**. 

## Step 3: Create and Upload a Service Key

1. In the Google Cloud console, create a [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role). 
2. Save the JSON with the service key.
3. Click **Upload Saved JSON File** and upload the service key. Click **Next**. 

## Step 4: Enter the BigQuery Dataset and Table ID

To connect the BigQuery data set and table:

1. Export your [Google Billing Data](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery) if you havenâ€™t already exported your cloud billing data to BigQuery.
2. In the Google Cloud console, go to the [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?_ga=2.3004535.613814368.1727093026-1117920196.1694069983&project=ocean-spark&ws=!1m0) page for your project.
3. Copy the BigQuery data set ID and table ID.
4. In the Billing Engine console, paste the data set ID and table ID.
5. Click **Connect Account**.
