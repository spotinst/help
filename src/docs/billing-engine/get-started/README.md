# Get Started with Billing Engine 

Spot can assist you in connecting your AWS and Azure account to Billing Engine. This section is designed to guide you through onboarding and ensure a smooth experience. 

If you have an Azure or Google Cloud account you would like to connect, create a [support](https://spot.io/support/) ticket, and our support team will assist you. 

One initial step for new Spot accounts is configuring the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR). This configuration is essential to effectively leveraging the capabilities of our Billing Engine. Once the CUR is set up, you can unlock powerful cost management features and gain valuable insights into your AWS spending. 

If you have a Microsoft Azure billing account and would like to connect it to our Billing Engine, we have provided procedures to guide you through the process.
