1. Log into your AWS Management Console.

The Billing & Cost Management Dashboard opens. 
3. From the dashboard, click **Cost & Usage Reports**. The AWS Cost and Usage Reports page opens.

4. Click Create report. The Report content page opens. 
5. Create a report name. 
6. Select the Include resource IDs checkbox, so that your report will include all the IDs from your individual resources.

The following window displays:
