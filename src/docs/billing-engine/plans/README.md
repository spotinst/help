# Plans 

Plans differ from Strategies in that they are tied to individual commercial offerings or special agreements that the Billing Engine user and their end consumer may be looking to represent. Plans will support three rule types that allow users to manipulate billing data across all cloud providers. These rules in turn can be ordered within their respective types to further control their application.  

Once a Plan and the associated rules are configured, it can affect the usage of the targeted cloud accounts or the cloud accounts within the targeted Family. A Plan and its rules affect all provider usage that qualifies based on the filters of the rules within Plans a user creates. Options surrounding Plan functionality would include:
