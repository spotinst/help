# Families 

Families are Billing Engine’s way to group accounts and subscriptions from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to help you organize your cloud billing data.

With families, you can:

* Group accounts to filter or group.
* Streamline creating reports in Analysis, and applying rules across accounts.
* Use rules so the accounts in the family act as if are their own bill. This allows you to refine and allocate costs as if the accounts were a true standalone cloud organization.

Once you’ve created a family, you can add or remove accounts from it. Keep in mind, accounts can only be assigned to one family at a time. You can remove an account from one family and immediately assign it to another.

You can remove a group of accounts by clicking ![image](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/167069628/c03958f2-9023-4d16-871d-f97ccedd64fc) next to a family. This does not delete the accounts themselves but removes them from the family. You can then add them to other families.

## Create a Billing Family
1. In the left main menu, click **Billing Engine**.
2. Select the Family tab and then click **Create Family**.
3. Enter a unique name for the family.
4. Click **Assign Accounts**, add available accounts or subscriptions, and then click **Assign**.
   The accounts that you include in this billing family can only be in this one billing family. An example of a family would be a project, internal business unit, or external client that uses any of these cloud services.
