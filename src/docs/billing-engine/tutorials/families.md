# Families 

Families are Billing Engine’s way to group together accounts and subscriptions from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud to help you organize your cloud billing data. With Families, you can apply billing rules over a desired grouping to show accurate chargeback and showback.

## Create Billing Family 

To create a family, complete the following steps:

In this page, you can create a name and add available accounts or subscriptions that haven’t been added to any other families yet. The name needs to be unique from the other billing families. The accounts that you include in this billing family can only be present in this one billing family. An example of a family would be a project, internal business unit or external client that leverages any of these cloud services.

After your family is created, the family is displayed on the Family dashboard.

The Family Details page opens. On this page, you can view information such as the family name, the accounts and subscriptions associated with it, and additional details pertaining to that particular account. You can also edit the family.

Under this view, you can edit the name, and accounts and subscriptions. When editing the name of the Family, ensure the name is unique. Two families cannot have the same name. 

When adding an account or subscription, it joins the family, and is no longer available to be added into another family. When you remove the account or subscription, you can add it to another billing family again.  

## Delete Family 

To delete a family, click the trash icon. Deleting a family removes the grouping of the accounts, not the accounts themselves. The accounts that were in the deleted family will become available again to join new families.
