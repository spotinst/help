# Features 

The procedures in this section describe how to maximize your Billing Engine policies, create strategies, and more.

The following list of Billing Engine features and terminology includes various tools and functionalities that allow organizations to track, analyze, and optimize their financial performance.

## Policies

This page includes permissions for [policies](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/billing-engine-policy) to access cost and usage data in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud providers. It explains the specific permissions required for each provider, including accessing the AWS Cost and Usage Report/Data Export, Azure roles like Enrollment Reader and MCA Billing Account Reader, and the Google Cloud Project Viewer Role.

## Families 

Billing Engine provides the concept of [Families](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/families) that allows you to group together accounts and subscriptions from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for better organization of cloud billing data. Families enable the application of billing rules to accurately track chargeback and showback.  

## Strategies 

Billing Engine includes default [strategies](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/strategies) for handling Reserved Instances (RI), Savings Plans, and discounts. You can create exceptions to deviate from the default billing strategy when necessary. Billing Strategies are available for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. 

## Plans 

[Plans](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/plans) is also a feature that is tied to specific commercial offerings or agreements. Plans support three rule types for manipulating billing data across all cloud providers. These rules can be ordered to control their application. Once a plan and its associated rules are configured, they can impact the usage of targeted cloud accounts or accounts within a specific family. 

## Analysis 

Billing [Analysis](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/analysis) displays cloud spending and provides detailed insights into your financial presence in the cloud. 

## Allocation Assignments

Allocation [Assignments](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/allocation-assignments) allows the allocation of costs based on specific identifiers, facilitating detailed cost reporting and analysis, and enabling association of accounts with specific entities or identifiers for more granular cost tracking.
