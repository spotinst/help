# Billing Engine 

Billing Engine organizes cloud billing data from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It introduces the concept of Families, which are used to group together accounts and subscriptions for better organization. Families enable users to apply billing rules to accurately track and allocate charges.  

You can also learn about billing strategies, which are default calculations and logic used by organizations for common billing scenarios such as buying and selling Reserved Instances (RI) and savings plans, managing discounts, and handling other concepts related to cloud billing. Billing Strategies can be customized to create exceptions for cases where usage needs to be treated differently from the default strategy. Billing Strategies are available for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. 

You can also use Billing Engineâ€™s Plans feature to view billing data, apply filters, customize actions, and control the order of rules to effectively manage and allocate cloud usage across multiple providers.
