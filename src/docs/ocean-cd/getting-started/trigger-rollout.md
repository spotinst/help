# Trigger a Rollout

To trigger your rollout, follow the tutorial below:

1. Make one or more changes to the SpotDeployment.Spec object of the SpotDeployment created

2. Apply it accordingly by running the following command:

```
kubectl apply â€“f <SD YAML> -n <namespace>
```

Both actions instantly trigger a rollout, which you can see in the Spot console.
