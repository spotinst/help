# Get Started with Ocean CD-

To get started with Ocean CD, you need to install the Ocean CD Operator and migrate your workload. The information below walks you through these procedures using the Spot console.

## Install the Operator using the Console

The procedure below describes how to install the Ocean CD Operator using the Spot console.

If you do not want to use the console, you can [install the Operator using the API or Helm](ocean-cd/getting-started/install-operator-using-API-or-helm).

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster running in AWS, Azure or GCP
- OLM installation
- Permissions from your CI tool to deploy new deployments into your clusters
- If you use permission lists or tools such as OPA, allow all of the images Ocean CD uses

## Get Started

Under Ocean CD in the Spot console, click Settings, and then click Add Cluster.

### Add Cluster

You can install the operator using either a [YAML](ocean-cd/getting-started/?id=YAML) file or using [HELM](ocean-cd/getting-started/?id=HELM).

#### YAML

When the Add Cluster window opens, complete the procedure below.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n02a.png" width="440" />

Complete the information below:

- Cluster Identifier: Your cluster ID must be unique, have up to 30 alphanumeric characters, and not contain spaces. It does not need to be related to the Ocean cluster ID (o-xxxxxx). Ocean CD can run on clusters that are not managed by Ocean.

- [Argo Rollout Installation](ocean-cd/?id=argo-rollouts-as-an-engine): Ocean CD dynamically generates and manages Argo rollout manifests. In the dropdown, indicate that you already have Argo installed in your cluster by choosing the option that applies to you.

- Click Download YAML. A YAML file is downloaded to your computer, and a new row appears in the Clusters list. Then, apply the YAML in your Kubernetes cluster.

Once you have downloaded the YAML, the new row will remain with partial information for two minutes. If two minutes have elapsed and the YAML was not applied, the row and the banner will be removed. However, the YAML can still be applied at another time, and the Ocean CD will display the new data accordingly.

You are now ready to migrate your workload.

#### HELM

When the Add Cluster popup appears, complete the procedure below.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n041.png" width="440" />

1. Click HELM and complete the information below:

- Cluster Identifier: Your cluster ID must be unique, have up to 30 alphanumeric characters, and not contain spaces. It is not coupled to the Ocean cluster ID (o-xxxxxx). Ocean CD can run on clusters that are not managed by Ocean.

- Token: The API Spot Token pre-generated via our console. If you do not have one, you may click on the generate button above the field. The API is saved as a personal token by Ocean CD.

- Argo Rollout Installation: Ocean CD dynamically generates and manages Argo rollout manifests. In the dropdown, define that you already have Argo installed in your cluster by choosing the option that applies to you.

**The See Commands button becomes active only after all three parameters are completed.**

2. Run all of the commands provided above into your Kubernetes cluster.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n042.png" width="440" />

#### Template Not Supported

Installation with a Helm template is not supported. Ocean CD enables you to run the commands pre-configured into your cluster or to download the values.yaml file where you can add additional requirements. In addition, the values.yaml file will accept any secret.yaml of yours instead of a hard-coded token.

You are now ready to migrate your workload.

## Migrate a Workload using the Console

The procedures below describes how to migrate a deployment to a SpotDeployment using the Spot console. This enables Ocean CD to manage the deployments that you migrate. The full migration process includes the creation of the RolloutSpec, the Strategy, the Verification Template, and the Verification Provider [entities](ocean-cd/concepts-features/entities).

The migration does not delete your original deployment. If there are any resources that you do not want to keep, you need to delete them manually.

For further information on the syntax of our entities, see examples in the [Ocean CD public repository](https://github.com/spotinst/spot-oceancd-releases/tree/main/Quick%20Start%20%26%20Examples)or the Entities page.

If you prefer to use an API, you can migrate your workload using the [Ocean CD API or CLI](ocean-cd/getting-started/migrate-using-api).

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster running in AWS, Azure or GCP.
- An Ocean CD Operator running in your cluster. Without the Operator, Ocean CD is not able to see resources running the cluster.

### Get Started

1. Under Ocean CD in the left sidebar, go to Workloads. You will see a list of all of your deployments.
2. Hover over the deployment to migrate, and click Migrate on the left side of the row.

3. The Workload Migration Flow provides an overview of the migration steps.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n06a.png"/>

Throughout the process, Ocean CD performs internal validations. Ocean CD notifies you in each step if a misplaced configuration is found and provides you with information to guide you.

### Migrate

Migrate your workload by completing the steps below. When you click Create, Ocean CD saves and applies your RolloutSpec and Strategy entities. Only the SpotDeployment YAML must be applied manually.

1. Migrate your Deployment to SpotDeployment by applying the changes described in the tutorial.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n061.png" />

> **Tip**: The first application of your SpotDeployments does not trigger a rollout. Only the pods are created. To trigger a rollout with the entities of your choice, you need to apply additional changes to the SpotDeployment (see step 4).

2. Edit the [strategy](ocean-cd/concepts-features/entities?id=strategy) and click Next. The strategy name should not exceed 63 characters. If you already have a strategy defined, click Skip.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n08a.png" />

3. Edit the template for the [RolloutSpec](ocean-cd/concepts-features/entities?id=rolloutspec). Choosing a traffic manager is optional. If you want to [specify a traffic manager](ocean-cd/getting-started/traffic-manager-reference), choose one from the dropdown list. When you choose a traffic manager, Ocean CD populates the template with the necessary traffic manager attributes. If you do not choose a traffic manager, Ocean CD will use the Kubernetes default traffic methods based on replicas. When you are finished editing, click Create.

> **Tip**: Any YAML entity you insert in your traffic object will need to be applied to the same namespace as your SpotDeployment.

4. Add changes to your SpotDeployment container spec and apply. A new rollout is created and triggered.
