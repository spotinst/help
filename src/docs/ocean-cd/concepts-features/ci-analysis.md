# CI Analysis

Ocean CD offers the capability to incorporate CI pipelines into Ocean CD rollouts. 

When creating your Verification Template, you have the flexibility to define one or more metrics that can trigger automation within your CI tool. 

The CI pipeline execution follows this sequence: 

1. During the analysis of the CI metric, a job is executed in the background. This job utilizes an image generated by Ocean CD, incorporating the parameters specified by users in the Verification Template. 
2. The job continuously pings the external URL until a status is received. 
3. When the job is finished, it provides a status indicating success or failure. This status is then displayed in the console for easy monitoring and tracking. 

## Supported CI tool 

* Jenkins 

The following tutorial describes how to use the feature in the Spot console: 

1. In the Metrics stage under the Verification Template tab, select **Jenkins** in the Provider field.

2. To customize the pipeline, enter the relevant information in the mandatory fields.  

3. Create a Verification Provider allowing Ocean CD access to the CI tool set in your Verification Provider.

4. The process is complete. The results of your CI pipeline are presented in real time during your rollout, indicating either a Passed or Failed status. This enables you to quickly assess the outcome of the CI pipeline and take appropriate actions based on the results.
