# End-to-End setup

This procedure describes how to install the Ocean CD operator and the Ocean CD entities using the Ocean CD Quickstart UI. This procedure will help you with all the necessary components to quickly deploy your first rollout.

## Prerequisites

- A cluster running Kubernetes (cloud agnostic)

## Step 1: Install the Operator

Install the operator to connect your cluster to Ocean CD.

**OLM allows Ocean CD to deploy our operator and provides a declarative way to manage and upgrade Ocean CD compoenents**.

1. Under Ocean CD in the Spot console, click Quick start, and then follow the prompts to create your first cluster if not already created. If you are connecting your first Ocean CD cluster, a seperate popup will help guide you through the setup process below:

- **Cluster Identifier**: This is a logical identifier for your cluster that must be unique and have up to 30 alphanumeric characters without any spaces. You can choose any ID and it does not need to be coupled to the Ocean cluster ID (o-xxxxxx). Ocean CD can run on clusters that are not managed by Ocean.

- [Argo Rollout Installation](https://docs.spot.io/ocean-cd/?id=argo-rollouts-as-an-engine): Ocean CD uses Argo rollouts as an underlying engine to faciliate rollouts and is required to trigger rollouts.

3. Download the YAML and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster.

`kubectl apply -f <Name of the YAML>`

When the process is complete and the operator pods are running, your cluster appears in the Cluster Settings section.

> **Tip**: Once you have downloaded the YAML, the new row remains with partial information for five minutes. If five minutes elapsed and the YAML was not applied, the row and the banner will be removed. However, the YAML can still be applied at a different time, and the Ocean CD displays the new data accordingly.

Once the Ocean CD operator is installed you can create your Kubernetes entities: Services and SpotDeployment.

## Step 2: Create a Namespace and Service

When a namespace is created, create the canary and stable services to expose and manage the traffic that is divided between the canary and the stable replicasets.

_For demo purposes, a traffic manager will not be used._

1. Copy and save the following YAML files. Each YAML is dedicated to one service:

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "Service"
metadata:
  name: "rollouts-demo-stable"
  namespace: "oceancd-workshop"
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "Service"
metadata:
  name: "rollouts-demo-canary"
  namespace: "oceancd-workshop"
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

2. Run the following command in your cluster for each of your services:

`kubectl apply -f <Service YAML>`

## Step 3: Create a SpotDeployment

To trigger the Ocean CD engine, you are required to use our CRD called SpotDeployment. The difference between a deployment and a SpotDeployment is the API version and kind.

1. Copy and save the following YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: "spot.io/v1beta1"
kind: "SpotDeployment"
metadata:
  name: "nginx-deployment"
  namespace: "oceancd-workshop"
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx:1.22
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

2. Copy and run the following command in your cluster:

`kubectl apply -f <SpotDeployment YAML>`

After the SpotDeployment and services are created, the remaining steps are to create the Ocean CD entities that act as the rules for your canary deployment to follow.

## Step 4: Create your Ocean CD Resources using the Ocean CD Quick Start

1. Navigate to the Quick start section within your Ocean CD console.

2. Select your existing cluster ID, Spot Deployment and Verification Provider (optional). The quick start will auto-populate YAML templates for all the Ocean CD entities required to support a canary deployment in seconds.

3. Click on "Create Resources" and review the Ocean CD entities within the UI Settings Tab.

> **Tip**: Learn more about [Ocean CD entities](ocean-cd/getting-started/rollout-entities/).

## Step 5: Trigger a Rollout

You can trigger your very first rollout. Change the pod spec template such as the image (for example, you may use: public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx:latest) in your SpotDeployment yaml and run the following command:

`kubectl apply -f <SpotDeployment YAML>`

A new canary rollout is initiated in the [All Rollouts](ocean-cd/tutorials/view-rollouts/) table. Click the Rollout ID of your deployment to view the detailed rollout page and take action from the console.
