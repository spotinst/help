# Spot Security Release Notes

## Features and Enhancements

* **SEC-002: June 2nd, 2024** With Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning, you can now examine your source code repository for misconfigurations. You can also integrate this with your pull requests (PRs), and Spot Security will comment on any detected misconfigurations on the PR itself. This enables you to take corrective actions before merging the pull request, helps ensure your infrastructure is properly configured, and minimizes the risks in your deployments.

* **SEC-001: May 22, 2024** Spot Security has released a new Prioritised Vulnerability feature. This feature is designed to streamline vulnerability patching by contextualizing CVEs based on the host they are detected on. Instead of solely relying on severity, this feature assigns a priority ranking from 1 to 100, with lower ranks indicating higher risk.
