# Spot Security Release Notes

## Features and Enhancements

* **SEC-001**: As of **May 22, 2024**, Spot Security has released a new feature called Prioritised Vulnerability. As you receive thousands of vulnerabilities, giving them quantifiable priority is of high importance. This feature uses not only the severity but contextualizes the CVEs based on the host they are detected on to give you a priority rank. As the rank increases, so does the risk of having the vulnerability exposed in the user's environment.
