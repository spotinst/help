This way, only authorized users can make changes to the security posture. [Learn more](spot-security/features/analyze-risks/remediate).

* **SEC-003 June 20, 2024** Spot Security has launched an enhanced version of the IAM Entitlement Analyzer. You can now run simple queries to determine who can perform specific actions on various assets. Additionally, it helps optimize policies by identifying duplicate and excessive privileges. [Learn more](spot-security/features/policy-engine).

* **SEC-002 June 2, 2024** With Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning, you can examine your source code repository for misconfigurations. You can also integrate this with your pull requests (PRs), and Spot Security will comment on any detected misconfigurations on the PR itself. This enables you to take corrective actions before merging the pull request, helps ensure your infrastructure is properly configured, and minimizes the risks in your deployments.

* **SEC-001 May 22, 2024** Spot Security has released a new Prioritised Vulnerability feature.
