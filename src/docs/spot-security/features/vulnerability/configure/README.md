2. Click the **Cloud Accounts** tab. You can view all of the onboarded accounts.

There are 3 states of the vulnerability scan configuration in an account: 

* The vulnerability scan is not configured: the toggle in the Vulnerability Enabled column is off and can not be turned on. 
* The vulnerability scan is configured and running: the toggle in the Vulnerability Enabled column is on. 
* The vulnerability scan is configured but temporarily disabled: the toggle in the Vulnerability Enabled column will be off but you can turn it on.  

## Prerequisites 

The account must be onboarded on Spot Security and the data collection must be complete.
