# Configure Vulnerability Scan 

Part of maintaining a secure environment is regularly conducting vulnerability scans. Vulnerability scans help identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by unauthorized individuals or entities. 

To view all the accounts that have vulnerability scanning enabled, complete the following steps:  

1. In the left main menu, click **Spot Security** and click **Administration**. 
2. Click the **Cloud Accounts** tab. You can view all of the onboarded accounts. 

 

 

 

There are 3 states of vulnerability configuration in an account: 

Vulnerability is not configured: the toggle in the Vulnerability Enabled column is off and can not be turned on. 

Vulnerability is configured and running: the toggle in the Vulnerability Enabled column is on. 

Vulnerability is configured but temporarily disabled: the toggle in the Vulnerability Enabled column will be off but you can turn it on.  

 

Prerequisites 

The account must be onboarded on Spot Security and the data collection must be complete.
