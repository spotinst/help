# Configure Vulnerability Scan for AWS 

This procedure describes how to configure vulnerability scans for AWS accounts. 

## Sign in to AWS Account 

1. In the Administration page, under the **Cloud Accounts** tab, click **Cloud Account** on the top right. 
2. Click **Configure VA** and select **AWS**. 
3. Click **Log in to AWS account** to log in to the account that you want to set up a vulnerability scan for.

4. Select the name of your AWS account in the dropdown menu.  You have the option to run the template provided by Spot Security.

7. Click the **Output** tab and copy the Value column. 
8. Enter the Role ARN that you copied in the previous step in the Role ARN field in the Spot Security console.  
9. By default, all the regions that have VMs will be pre-populated for a selected account. You can delete regions according to your preference. For each region, select a VPC ID:Subnet ID where the Spot Security Scanner will run. 

* The list contains only public Subnet IDs that enable connection using a Internet-Gateway. 
* Spot Security recommends enabling **Enable auto-assign public IPV4 address** in the Subnet settings. You can also do this by clicking the subnet, and then click **Action** and then select **Edit subnet settings**.

* If it is disabled, Spot Security creates an Elastic IP for the scanner instance.  
* There is a default quota of five Elastic IPs per account per region. Spot Security creates an Elastic IP for the scanner instance. Log in to your AWS account and click [here](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fus-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com%2Fservicequotas%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fec2%2Fquotas%2FL-0263D0A3%3FhashArgs%3D%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue%26region%3Dus-east-1%26state%3DhashArgsFromTB_us-east-1_2de16467b5c9e198&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Asignin%3A%3A%3Aconsole%2Fservicequotas&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=Zufe-fUc1eZDZ_CVpbmg3P4bl_EcrQxsmGrmMGB6jgg&code_challenge_method=SHA-256).  Select the appropriate region to check adequate capacity available to create a single Elastic IP address for Spot Security in that account and region. 

* You can select a Subnet ID matching the above criteria from the list.

* You can also create a new public Subnet ID using internet-Gateway for Spot Security and **Enable auto-assign public IPV4 address** in the Subnet settings. To enter the recently created Subnet ID you can check **Manually enter VPC ID: Subnet ID**.
