# Vulnerability Scan Dashboard 

The Vulnerability Scan feature provides visibility into the CVEs impacting your VMs on several levels of granularity including affected volumes,OS, packages etc. 

To analyze your vulnerbilities,  click **Spot Security** in the left main menu of the console and click **Vulnerbilities**. 

In the Vulnerbilities page, there are two main tabs: 

* Overview 
* All Vulnerabilities  

## Overview 

The Overview section is divided into four parts: 

* Summary 
* New Alerts Trend 
* Open CVE Count 
* Vulnerability Alerts Distribution 

### Summary 

The Summary section provides a brief overview of the vulnerability alerts and their analytic data. The summary provides the following information: 

* **Total Number of Alerts**: The sum of all of the affected assets due to each CVE open until today. 
* **Alerts patched in last 30 Days**: The sum of all the affected assets fixed in each CVE. 
* **Average day to resolve**: The average number of days to fix an alert over the last 30 days. 
* **Alerts open within last 30 days**: The sum of all of the affected assets found in each CVE and still open today. 
* **Alerts reopened within the last 30 days**: The sum of the affected assets that were patched in the last 30 days for a CVE but have reappeared again and are still open today.

### Open CVE Count 

The Open CVE Count helps you to determine CVE counts and the severity distribution which can be grouped by account, region, OS, or package.

### Vulnerability Alerts Distribution 

The last section of the overview page gives you the distribution of alerts i.e sum of affected assets across different categories such as account, region, severity, OS, or package.

## All Vulnerabilities  

The All Vulnerabilities tab presents a comprehensive table of detected CVEs. It provides insights into the CVEs, vulnerbility description, failed assets, asset details, CVSS V2 and V3 Score, severity etc. This information helps you decide which CVE to target.  

![vuln-dshb-5](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/106514736/6d482451-452e-4b16-9556-4e80a97507d4)

Click the number in the Failed Assets row of CVE you want to check. The number redirects you to the page of the Failed Assets and All Findings tabs. You will be able to see the vulnerability summary, the references to the nvd page and the failed asset table. The table provides information of the asset name, asset type, asset ID representing the details of the affected assets. It also shows the number of volumes, OS and packages that were affected by the CVEs in the assets along with the total number of findings.  

![vuln-dshb-6](https://github.com/spotinst/help/assets/106514736/fdc1d667-30d7-4529-98c8-0ada6925f8bb)

### Patched Assets 

You can filter the assets by clicking the filter icon. Select the type of filter you want to apply in the filter drop-down menus. To view patched assets, set the following drop-down menus in the following fields:  
* Attribute: select **Status**.  
* Operater: select **Equals**   
* Value: select **Patched**.  

All of the available CVEs show which assets have been patched in the last month. Similarly, you can filter the reopened assets in the last month.
