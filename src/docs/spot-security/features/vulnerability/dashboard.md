# Vulnerability Scan Dashboard 

Vulnerability scanning identifies the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) impacting your VMs and containers. You can view the vulnerabilities according to categories and trends.

To analyze your vulnerabilities in the Spot console, click **Spot Security** > **Vulnerabilities**.

If an instance is terminated, it will be excluded from the data from the next scan.

The dashboard gives you:

* A high-level understanding of vulnerability alerts and analytics data.
* Insights by cloud service provider, account, asset type, and region.
* Ability to monitor the new finding trends to track the number of affected assets over time.
* Analysis of the open common vulnerabilities and exposures. The severity distribution can be viewed by category, such as account, region, OS, or package.
* The distribution of findings by category, such as region, severity, OS, or package.

## What can you do on the dashboard?

* Filter vulnerabilities by cloud provider, account, asset type, and region.
* Create [asset groups](spot-security/features/security-dashboard/?id=filters-and-asset-groups) to view data.
* Exclude stopped instances.
* View the full list of common vulnerabilities and exposures. From this list, you can target CVEs to investigate. Click the total findings number for a CVE to view the vulnerability details.
