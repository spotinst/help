# Create a Preset

A preset is a set of filter settings that you have saved and can access for later use in the [Security Dashboard](spot-security/features/security-dashboard/). Presets enable you to see security summaries for specific accounts, services, and regions.
Presets have user preference retention and when they are created, they will not be visible to another user. The default preset settings are specific to each user.

## Create a Preset

Once you have created a new preset, the name will appear as part of the Security Summary title.

## Edit or Delete a Preset

The edit function enables you to change the preset name or to change the default. To make one of these changes, go to the preset in the dropdown list and click the pencil icon in the same row. Make your changes and save.
