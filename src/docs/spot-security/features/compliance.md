# Compliance

Spot Security provides information on how compliant your organization is with global security standards.  

To view your compliance with global security standards, go to Spot Security in the left menu of the console and click Compliance.

## Security Compliance

You can review the compliance of your assets under two tabs:  
* Total Compliance: Provides information on how your organization complies with global security standards.
* CIS Benchmark: Provides compliance information against CIS recommended standards.

## Favorite Standards Chart

You can select a compliance from the provided list as a favorite.   

The line graph shows the compliance of the assets in your cloud infrastructure with the global security standards marked as favorite. You can select the time frames of two weeks, one month, or three months. You can also view the compliance of assets on a specific date using Snapback. Click Export to export the summary of the compliance to an Excel sheet.

Hovering over a specific line that represents a global security standard shows the percentage of the compliance of the global security standard.
