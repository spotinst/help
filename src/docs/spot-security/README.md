# Spot Security

Using its methodology of Analyze, Detect, and Act, Spot Security enables you to rapidly understand your cloud security posture on the public cloud and attack surface and compliance gaps. Spot Security provides unprecedented visibility into your cloud deployment, and you can set it up within minutes.

## Security Challenge on the Public Cloud

Public clouds are elastic in nature, leading to an ever changing dynamic environment and making it difficult to fully understand and control. Keeping up with your infrastructure and its security is impossible without automation. Basic controls such as data and resources showing public exposures or misconfigurations are not readily available. With millions of events occurring every day, a massive effort is required to sift through the noise and understand your security posture.  

## Spot Security Solution

Spot Security enables public cloud security whereby you and your operation teams have complete visibility of your cloud infrastructure. Spot Security provides a single pane of glass for all your cloud security operations with the Analyze, Detect, and Act approach.

The Analyze function continuously assesses your cloud platform’s security policy configuration, usage, and network activity to understand your usage of the cloud.
Detect brings meaning into the analysis by detecting anomalies or configuration drifts.
Act provides the means to solve the identified issues with step by step or automated remediation, prevention, and a compliance view.

As your cloud changes, this process repeats itself continuously to support your cloud security team.

## Get Started

To take advantage of the Spot Security features, simply log into your existing Spot account and click Security on the side bar. For no cost and without any changes to your current Spot configuration, you will be able to get a set of initial security insights that we gather from your environment. To enable all the security features, simply click Subscribe, and you will complete a guided process to update your Spot policy. After a few minutes, all the security findings will be available. Detecting anomalies and drift requires additional data, and should be available within a few days.
