#  Availability Zones Recommendations for AWS Ocean K8s

Availability Zones scores and recommendations assist you in making informed decisions when selecting the best availability Zones for launching instances. The data on the Recommendations tab for a cluster is based on the Availability Zones scores calculated by Ocean, considering both Cost and Spot market availability. 

The Availability Zones scores data directly relates to the allowed instance types configured in your Virtual Node Group to ensure that customized data is displayed.

1.  In the left main menu, click **Ocean** and click **Cloud Clusters**.
2.  Select a cluster from the list of clusters.
3.  Click the **Recommendations tab**.
4.  Select a Virtual Node Group.
