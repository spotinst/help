#  Select VMs for an AKS Virtual Node Group


This topic describes selecting VM sizes in your cluster per Virtual Node Group (custom or template) according to your application needs. An advanced attributes filter lets you search for the optimal VMs for the task from any of the VM families available on the [Azure cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview?tabs=breakdownseries%2Cgeneralsizelist%2Ccomputesizelist%2Cmemorysizelist%2Cstoragesizelist%2Cgpusizelist%2Cfpgasizelist%2Chpcsizelist). Once you have sized your VMs, Ocean can use your customization for its scaling processes.
