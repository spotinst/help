#  Select VMs for an AKS Virtual Node Group

Cloud service provider relevance: <font color="#FC01CC">AKS</font> 

This topic describes selecting VM sizes in your cluster per Virtual Node Group (custom or template) according to your application needs. An advanced attributes filter lets you search for the optimal VMs for the task from any of the VM families available on the [Azure cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview?tabs=breakdownseries%2Cgeneralsizelist%2Ccomputesizelist%2Cmemorysizelist%2Cstoragesizelist%2Cgpusizelist%2Cfpgasizelist%2Chpcsizelist). Once you have sized your VMs, Ocean can use your customization for its scaling processes.

To select the VMs for your Cluster:

1. In the left main menu, click **Ocean** > **Cloud Clusters**.

2. Select a cluster from the list of clusters.

3. Click the  **Virtual Node Groups** tab.

4. In the panel on the top left of the screen, fill in and select settings for the Virtual Node Group, such as Availability Zones and the maximum Number of pods per node.

5. Scroll down to the **VM Selection** panel, which provides these options:

   * Automatic: Let Spot select your VM sizes according to the needs of your applications.
   * Advanced VM Size Selection: Use attribute filters to select VMs with customized sizes from which Ocean can scale.

6. If you selected **Automatic**, click **Save** to complete the procedure.
7. If you selected **Advanced VM Size Selection**: View each VM type's currently selected size, vCPU, Memory (GiB), and GPU units in the VM Selection list.
The Advanced VM Size Filtering controls to the right of the VM Selection list let you filter these attributes for the VMs:
   * Upper and lower limits for No. Of vCPUs (up to 256).
   * Upper and lower limits for the Memory (up to 1024 GiB).
   * Upper and lower limits for the No. Of GPUs (up to 8).
   * GPU type.
   * Exclude Series: You can exclude any series by clicking Exclude in the VM Selection List row for that series (or by typing the series in the Exclude Series field. The series then appears in the Exclude Series filter in the filtering controls.
   * Include Series: You can include VMs in the Include Series field. For example, to select a GPU type, include the series and VM types.
   * VM Types.
   * Architectures (values taken from your Virtual Node Group template).
   * Disk performance (standard or premium).
   * Minimum no of data disks (up to 64).
   * Minimum no. of NICs (up to 16).
   * Turn Accelerated networking on or off.

8. Click **Apply** to filter the VM Selection list. All your filters are applied to the VM list. A color-coded bar appears above the list to provide a rating for the applied filter.

>**Note**: An error is displayed if you define an incorrect VM type.

9. Repeat the previous steps until you are satisfied with the results.
10. Save the changes for the Virtual Node Group.
