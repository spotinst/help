# Headroom

One of Ocean’s key features for optimizing scaling is _headroom_, a buffer of spare capacity ensuring that a cluster is always ready for a rapid application scale up.

When you configure headroom in specific amounts of resources (i.e., vCPU, memory, and GPU), or specify headroom as a percentage of the cluster’s total requested resources, the cluster can scale workloads without waiting for new instances to be provisioned.

Ocean optimally manages the headroom dynamically in order to provide the best possible cost-performance balance. Alternatively, headroom may be configured manually to support any use case.

## How It Works

Ocean continually checks if there are unscheduled workloads (pods or tasks) in the cluster. If unscheduled workloads are found, Ocean simulates placing them on the existing infrastructure.

Since Ocean has saved compute resources in advance (i.e., created headroom), the container orchestrator can use these resources and schedule the unscheduled workloads on these nodes instantly. Once the headroom has been used for scaling up workloads, Ocean will provision more infrastructure to balance the headroom amount in preparation for the next scale up of services.

Headroom can be configured using one of two mechanisms, automatic or manual.

## Automatic Headroom

Automatic refers to headroom that is dynamic and designed to predict the next scale up of services in the cluster. It is limited by a percent of the overall resources requested by the cluster’s workloads.

When you configure automatic headroom, Ocean calculates the total amount of resources (CPU, memory, and GPU) deployed in the cluster and then allocates a certain percent of that to be available as spare capacity. The default is 5%, but the value is user configurable.

Ocean continually monitors the cluster and creates headroom according to the following process, in order to prepare the cluster for the next workload scale out:

1. According to historical workload behavior that is monitored continuously, Ocean sorts the cluster’s workloads according to their chance and scope of scaling out.
2. Based on the top 5 workloads’ request size, Ocean provisions infrastructure that is able to facilitate a scale out of those workloads, considering all of their constraints.
3. As per the total amount of headroom, Ocean continually balances so that it matches the percentage of resources defined by the user.

As these steps are repeated, the desired percent of headroom is maintained at all times.

### Automatic Headroom per Virtual Node Group

It is possible to define automatic headroom per virtual node group (VNG). The calculation of the automatic headroom in the VNG is the same as the calculation for the cluster as described above. This means that Ocean takes all of the workloads that run on a given VNG and calculates the headroom for that VNG using the same method it would for calculating headroom for the cluster.

The automatic headroom and the headroom per VNG are calculated independently. Therefore, there is a possibility that the headroom per cluster and per VNG will save headroom for the same workload. In order to avoid this situation, you should set the headroom only at VNG level.

## Manual Headroom

While automatic headroom is the recommended configuration, you can also set up manual headroom on top of automatic headroom. Defined per VNG, manual headroom adds flexibility to help with specific use cases.

Manual refers to headroom that is configured as specific amounts of resources, and is relevant for users who are aware of specific needs in the cluster.

Another way to define headroom is by specific resource amounts. This way is most useful when the cluster has a predicted behavior whereby the services scaling up and their headroom needs are known.

Setting the manual headroom is done by setting headroom units -- i.e., chunks of resources such as CPU, memory, and GPU -- to be provisioned and saved for future scale out.

In order to set those units for different workloads with different constraints, manual headroom can be defined at the [VNG](ocean/features/launch-specifications) level. This ensures that the provisioned spare capacity will exist on nodes that have the right configuration to run the scaling workloads.

For example, a VNG is configured to maintain two headroom units of 2048 MiB and 2000 CPU, and another VNG is configured to maintain two headroom units of the same size. Then, a total of four headroom units will be maintained at all times, where two units each will match each of the corresponding VNGs.

### Note for AWS and GKE Users

Due to backward compatibility considerations, you will need to activate a switch in the configuration in order to enable automatic and manual headroom to work in parallel. Otherwise, automatic headroom overrides all other headroom definitions manually configured, whether they are at cluster or VNG level. You may enable automatic and manual headroom at the Ocean level by setting `autoScaler.enableAutomaticAndManualHeadroom` to True.
