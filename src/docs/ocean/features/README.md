# Features

Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers. It continuously analyzes how your containers are using infrastructure, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability utilizing the optimal blend of spot, reserved and on-demand compute instances.

This section describes Ocean features in detail.

## Ocean for Kubernetes (AWS)

Unless specifically stated otherwise, all of the features described in this section are supported in Ocean for AWS.
