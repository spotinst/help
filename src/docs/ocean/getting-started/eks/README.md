# Getting Started with EKS

It is really easy to get started with Ocean for EKS, as it provides a simple flow to connect an existing EKS cluster and multiple ways to create new EKS clusters already connected to Ocean.

If you have already connected your AWS account to Ocean, you can start with Ocean for EKS. (If not connected yet, [connect your AWS account](connect-your-cloud-provider/aws-account).)
