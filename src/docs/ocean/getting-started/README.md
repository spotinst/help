# Getting Started

It is really easy to get started with Ocean. It integrates with multiple container and Kubernetes environments including ECS, EKS, and GKE as well as with your existing DevOps tools, such as Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible, to support your cloud-native applications.

To get started with an Ocean cluster, connect your Cloud account now: [AWS](connect-your-cloud-provider/aws-account), [Azure](connect-your-cloud-provider/azure-account), [GCP](connect-your-cloud-provider/gcp-project). Once you have connected your account, here are several ways to create an Ocean-managed cluster.
