      resources: ["replicasets", "statefulsets"]
      verbs: ["patch", "update"]
    ```

## Chart Version [0.1.44] (v2.0.58) - 2024-05-27

### Added
* Improved event pushing mechanism - we are now spliting events into chunks to avoid large gRPC messages.
* Improved controller heartbeat mechanism.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed empty error log (added in `v2.0.56`).

## Chart Version [0.1.42] (v2.0.55) - 2024-05-05

### Added
* We are now using the same backend host as controller V1 - `api.spotinst.io`.

## Chart Version [0.1.41] (v2.0.54) - 2024-04-25

### Bug Fixes
* <p>
   Improved mechanism for getting resources to report to the backend. We now support older APIs of resources (for example: `autoscaling/v2beta2`, `node.k8s.io/v1beta1`, `policy/v1beta1`, etc.).
   </p>

    <p>
    Also, we now validate read permissions for each resource before initializing the informers.

* Added update Kubernetes Deployment capability.

## Chart Version [0.1.28] (v2.0.50) - 2024-03-17
