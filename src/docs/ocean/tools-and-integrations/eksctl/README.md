# eksctl

As the official [AWS CLI tool](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/eksctl-eks-cli/), eksctl is an open-source CLI that has gained popularity within the Kubernetes community for easily creating Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. One of the benefits of EKS itself is that the Kubernetes control plane is handled entirely by AWS, freeing you from managing high availability for your control plane(s) as well as from handling all ongoing maintenance such as Kubernetes upgrades.

However, when it comes to your clusters' worker nodes, you still need to find a solution that simplifies container infrastructure management by handling challenges like:

- Unavailable resources due to autoscaling that only looks at cluster CPU and Memory and not actual Pod requirements
- Cost visibility (showback) that allocates spend based on namespaces, resources, labels, and annotations
- Pod rightsizing based on analysis of their actual resource consumption
- Handling immediate container scaling for high priority workloads
- Reducing cloud infrastructure costs using spot instances and preemptible VMs

Fortunately, Ocean takes care of all these time-consuming, DevOps activities, with container-driven autoscaling, cloud-native cost allocation, vertical rightsizing, a customizable buffer of spare nodes and optimized utilization of the perfect blend of spot instances, reserved capacity and on-demand resources.

Integration with eksctl enables you to streamline and optimize the entire EKS process, from initially creating your cluster to managing and optimizing it on an ongoing basis.
