# Getting Started with KOPS

Kubernetes Operations, or [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), is an open source project used to set up Kubernetes clusters. The project describes itself as kubectl for clusters. `kops` enables deployment of highly available Kubernetes clusters on AWS.

It is really easy to get started with Ocean using `kops`, as it provides a simple flow to create an EKS cluster.

To get started, complete the procedures in [Getting Started with kops on Spot Ocean](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/spot-ocean/).
