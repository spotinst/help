# Prometheus for Kubernetes Data-Plane Monitoring

Ocean manages the scaling of the Kubernetes data-plane and the data generated  in the process could be valuable for monitoring your containerized environment.  Using well-defined Prometheus metrics for monitoring Ocean can accelerate your understanding of the cluster scaling and debugging of issues that may come up. In addition, you can build alerts based on the metrics to address issues in real time and track important trends on a dashboard of different Ocean metrics.  

Ocean maintains an official set of metrics, natively scrapable by Prometheus. This set of metrics helps to build a 360 degree view of the actions Ocean takes, while providing application-driven infrastructure.

## Ocean Metrics

By monitoring a few key metrics you can gain an understanding of how Ocean scales. TThe metrics are described below with examples and are relevant to Ocean Prometheus Exporter for AWS Kubernetes and GCP.

### ocean_managed_nodes

This metric tracks the total number of nodes managed by Ocean in the cluster. The metric could be useful in responding to unnatural anomalies. In addition, the metric provides an easy breakdown to monitor specific [virtual node groups](ocean/features/vngs/) in the cluster as well as other infrastructure characteristics such as instance lifecycle and type.

Prometheus metric type: gauge

Dimensions: `vng_id`, `lifecycle="Spot/OD/Preemptible"` , `az/zone`, `vm_type`, `ocean_name`, `vng_name`, `ocean_id`

Example:  
```
ocean_managed_nodes {vng_id="default", lifecycle="Spot", az="us-west-2a", vm_type="c5.2xlarge", ocean_name=”Prod”, vng_name = “default”, ocean_id= “o-XXXXX”} 13

ocean_managed_nodes {vng_id="ols-xxxxxxxx", lifecycle="OD", az="us-west-2b", type="c5.2xlarge", ocean_name=”Prod” , vng_name = “Vng1”,ocean_id= “o-XXXXX”} 2

ocean_managed_nodes {vng_id="ols-xxxxxxxx", lifecycle="Spot", az="us-west-2b", vm_type="m5.8xlarge",  vng_name = “Vng2”, ocean_id= “o-XXXXX”} 3
```

### Ocean_Nodes_added_total and Ocean_Nodes_removed_total

These counter type metrics help track the rate of addition and removal of nodes in the cluster and the different reasons behind them, as reflected in a dedicated label called Reason. Reason includes values such as: 

* `pendingPodsOrHeadroom` - The node was scaled up by the Ocean autoscaler due to unscheduled pending pods or missing Headroom units on your cluster.  
* `scaleDownForOptimization` - The node was scaled down by the Ocean autoscaler to optimize resource utilization on your cluster.  
* `odToSpotReplacement` - The node was scaled up/down due to a replacement from an on-demand to a spot node. The on-demand node was launched because there was no available spot node in the market at the time, Ocean continues scanning the market for an available spot node and reverts as soon as there is one available.  
* `autoHealingReplacement` - The node was scaled up/down due to a replacement from an unhealthy instance to a new one. Ocean checks the instance’s status after the grace period and if an instance fails the health check, it is automatically replaced with a new instance.  
* `riUtilizationReplacement` (relevant only to AWS) - The node was scaled up/down due to a replacement from spot/OD to RI. Ocean constantly monitors for available RIs or Savings Plans in your account 	(when the `strategy.utilizeReservedInstances` or `utilizeCommitments` flag is	enabled). If there is an Ocean monitored node that runs as a spot or OD, Ocean will try to replace it with the available RI or Savings Plan nodes. 
* `recoveryReplacement` -  The node was scaled down since the instance was taken by the provider. As part of the recovery process, a new node was scaled up to replace the instance that was taken. 
* `revertToLowerCostReplacement` -  The node was scaled up/down due to the ‘Revert to lower cost’ process. For more information click [here](ocean/features/revert-to-lower-cost-node?id=revert-to-lower-cost-node). 
* `shutdownHoursActivity` - The node was scaled up/down due to shutdown hours set on your cluster. For more information click [here](ocean/features/running-hours?id=shutdown-hours).  
* `clusterRollReplacement` - The node was scaled up/down due to a cluster roll in your cluster. For more information click [here](ocean/features/roll?id=roll).  
* `workloadMigration` (relevant only to AWS)- The node was scaled up due to a workload migration process on your cluster. For more information click [here](ocean/tutorials/migrate-workload-via-ui?id=migrate-workload-using-the-console). 

Prometheus metric type: counter

Dimensions: `reason`, `VNG_Id`, `lifecycle="Spot/OD/Preemptible"`, `az/zone`, `vm_type`, `Ocean_Name`, `vng_name`, `ocean_id`, `Node_name` (optional, only for ocean_nodes_removed_total)

Example:
```
nodes_added_toal{reason="revertToLowerCostReplacement", lifecycle="Spot", az="us-west-2a", vm_type="c5.xlarge", vng_name = “Vng2”, ocean_id= “o-XXXXX”} 46
nodes_added_total{reason="scaleUpForPendingPods", lifecycle="Spot", az="us-west-2b", vm_type="r5a.4xlarge", vng_name = “Vng2”, ocean_id= “o-XXXXX”} 13
```

## Tracking Ocean Managed Resources

It is also useful to track Ocean managed resources in order to get a full picture.

### ocean_allocatable_cpu_vcpus, ocean_allocatable_memory_gibs, ocean_allocatable_gpu_units

These metrics track the total resources allocatable by all nodes in the cluster.

Prometheus metric type: gauge

Dimensions: `VNG_Id`, `lifecycle="Spot/OD/Preemptible"` , `az/zone`, `vm_type`, `Ocean_Name`, `vng_name`, `ocean_id`

Example:
```
allocatable_cpu{vng_id="ols-xxxxxxxx", lifecycle="OD/Spot/RI/SP", az="us-west-2a", vm_type="c5.2xlarge", vng_name = “Vng2”, ocean_id= “o-XXXXX”, “ocean_name”: “Prod”} 45
```

### ocean_allocatable_headroom_vcpus, ocean_allocatable_headroom_memory_gibs, ocean_allocatable_headroom_gpu_units

This metric tracks the total resource allocatable as headroom in all nodes in the cluster.

Prometheus metric type: gauge

Dimensions: `VNG_Id`, `lifecycle="Spot/OD/Preemptible"` , `az/zone`, `vm_type`, `Ocean_Name`, `vng_name`, `ocean_id`

Example:  
```
 allocatable_headroom_gpu{vng_id="ols-xxxxxxxx", lifecycle="OD", az="us-west-2a", vm_type="c5.2xlarge",  vng_name = “Vng2”, ocean_id= “o-XXXXX”, “ocean_name”: “prod”} 12
 ```

## Tracking Healthiness

### ocean_controller_heartbeat_info

This metric is a measure of the controller health in the cluster. The metric tracks Ocean connectivity health.

Prometheus metric type: gauge

Dimensions:  `Ocean_Name`, `ocean_id`

Example:  
```
ocean_controller_heartbeat_info{ “ocean_name”: “prod”, “ocean_id”: o-XXXXXX} 1
```

## Tracking Ocean Cluster Configurations

### ocean_cluster_limits_cpu_vcpu, ocean_cluster_limits_memory_gib  

These metrics return the value of the CPU and memory limits configured on the Ocean level.  
This can be used to set alerts when the limit is reached.

Prometheus metric type: gauge  

Dimensions: `ocean_name`, `ocean_id`

Example:
```
ocean_cluster_limits_cpu_vcpu{ocean_id="o-xxxxx", ocean_name="xxxx"} 203
```
