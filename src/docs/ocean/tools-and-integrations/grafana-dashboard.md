# Grafana Dashboard

Cloud service provider relevance: <font color="#FC01CC">AWS Kubernetes</font>

This topic describes the integration of [Ocean](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/) with Grafana and Prometheus to help you identify and investigate real-life anomalies in Ocean-managed clusters.

## Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus and Grafana are among the most popular observability stacks in the market, especially within the DevOps community. Prometheus is a robust monitoring and alerting toolkit that scrapes and stores time series data, providing real-time insights into various metrics within your cluster. 

Grafana enhances Prometheus by offering powerful data visualization capabilities so you can create informative and interactive dashboards.

In Kubernetes environments, where the dynamic nature of workloads and infrastructure demands continuous monitoring, the Prometheus and Grafana stack provides deep visibility into the performance, health, and cost-effectiveness of your Kubernetes clusters, enabling proactive management and optimization.

## Spot Ocean Scaling and Cost Optimization Grafana Dashboard

The Ocean scaling and cost optimization dashboard provides real-time insights into the scaling, cost, usage, and right-sizing activities managed by Ocean within your Kubernetes cluster. It displays node provisioning, optimization, cost efficiency, and recovery operations metrics.  

Visualizations can help you understand how Ocean dynamically manages Kubernetes cluster resources to ensure optimal performance, cost savings, and high availability. Key actions such as scale-ups, scale-downs, node replacements, and manual interventions are highlighted to give a comprehensive view of your cluster's operational status and health. 

Visualizations include data on compute, storage, and networking expenses, helping you monitor and optimize cloud spending. They also highlight the cost distribution across different resource types and track usage patterns over time. 

The scaling and cost optimization dashboard exposes data that helps you make informed decisions about resource allocation, identify cost-saving opportunities, and ensure efficient utilization of cloud infrastructure. For Ocean right-sizing evaluations, the dashboard shows how efficient resource adjustments contribute to cost reduction while maintaining optimal cluster performance.

### Integration Benefits

Ocean manages the scaling of the Kubernetes data plane, and the data generated in the process can be valuable for monitoring your containerized environment. 

Using well-defined [Prometheus metrics](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/tools-and-integrations/prometheus/) to monitor Ocean provides insights into cluster scaling and debugging. You can also build alerts based on the metrics to address real-time issues and track trends on a dashboard with different Ocean metrics.

Ocean maintains an official set of metrics, natively scrapable by Prometheus. This set of metrics helps build a 360-degree view of Ocean’s actions while providing application-driven infrastructure.
