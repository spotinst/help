# Event Policies

The Spot console provides a robust and flexible tool for configuring and managing notifications. Spot uses a system of user-definable policies, providing granular management of event notifications and customization to fit different business cases. You can customize notification policies by:

- Resources monitored
- Events to be notified
- Notification mediums such as Slack, email, and SNS
- Users and stakeholders to be notified

You can create policies for:
   * [Compute](https://docs.spot.io/administration/notification-center/event-policies/create) for notifications for compute products, such as Elastigroup and Ocean resources.
   * [Security](https://docs.spot.io/administration/notification-center/event-policies/create-security-policy) for notifications for security products.
   * [Ocean CD](https://docs.spot.io/administration/notification-center/event-policies/create-ocean-cd-policy) for notifications for Ocean CD.

You can access event policies:

1. In the Spot console, click the user icon <img height="14" src="https://docs.spot.io/administration/_media/usericon.png">  > **Settings**.
2. Click **Notification Center** > **Event Policies**.

## Event Policies Dashboard

The Event Policies dashboard provides an overview of notification policies and basic status information about each policy.
