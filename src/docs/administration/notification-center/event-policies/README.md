# Event Policies

The Spot console provides a robust and flexible tool for configuring and managing notifications. Spot uses a system of user definable policies, providing granular management of event notifications and customization to fit different business cases. This includes the ability to customize notification policies per:

- Resources monitored
- Events to be notified
- Notification mediums such as Slack, email, and SNS
- Users and stakeholders to be notified

## Get Started

To access the event policies, do the following:

1. In the upper right of the Spot console, click the User icon, and then click My Account in the menu.
