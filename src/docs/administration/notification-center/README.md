# Notification Center

The Notification Center provides a robust tool for defining the types of notifications you receive. This includes a tool for creating and editing notification policies, and a tool for reading system notifications about events in your clusters, news messages from Spot by NetApp, and previews of the latest [blog pages](https://spot.io/blog/).

## Notifications

Spot provides notifications about the resources it manages. In the [Event Policies](administration/notification-center/event-policies/) page, you configure the types of events you want to receive notifications about. Whenever an event triggers a new notification, a red indicator shows on the notification bell at the top right of the Spot console.

The preview panel shows these types of notifications:
- Spot notifications: These messages are sent from Spot by NetApp and may include announcements about new features or information about Spot products and services. Spot notifications are shaded and sticky, meaning that they are pinned to the top of the list for a certain time period. When that time period is up, the notification appears with all the other notifications.
- Event notifications: These are messages about events in your system. The messages appear according to what you have configured in the Notification Policies page. Icons on the notifications indicate the severity of the issue and which product the notification relates to.

Click a message preview to view and read the full message. The main notification list appears in the middle of the page and includes all of the messages you have received.

The shaded notifications at the top are sent from Spot by NetApp and may include announcements about new features or information about Spot products and services. Spot notifications are sticky, meaning that they are pinned to the top of the list for a certain time period. When that time period for a notification is up, it appears unshaded with all the other notifications.

The unshaded notifications are about events in your system (except for the Spot messages that have been unshaded). The notifications appear according to what you have configured in the Event Policies page. Icons on the event notifications indicate the severity of the issue and which product the notification relates to.
