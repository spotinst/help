# Groups

In Spot, a group is a set of [users](administration/users-a/) who have the same [policies](administration/policies/). You use groups to assign or modify policies for several users at once. You can use different types of groupings for managing users, for example:

- By Spot service: Eco users, Elastigroup users, Ocean Users
- By access role: admins, account editors, account viewers, credit card editors
- By organizational department or function: developers, finance department, sales department

You can associate one user with multiple groups.

You can easily [create a new group](administration/groups/create-new-group) with the creation wizard:
1. Define the basic group details such as the group name and a brief description of the group purpose.
2. Add users to the group.
3. Attach policies to the group, which controls the permissions that users in the group will have.

From the list of groups, you can:
* [Create a new group](administration/groups/create-new-group)
* View group details
* Click on a group to view more information and edit the group's:
  * [Users](administration/users-a/)
  * [Permission policies](administration/policies/)
* Delete a group
