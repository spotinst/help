# Groups

In Spot, a group is a set of [users](administration/users-a/) who have the same [policies](administration/policies/). You use groups to assign or modify policies for several users at once. You can use different types of groupings for managing users, for example:

- By Spot service: Eco users, Elastigroup users, Ocean Users
- By access role: admins, account editors, account viewers, credit card editors
- By organizational department or function: developers, finance department, sales department

You can associate one user with multiple groups.

From the list of groups, you can:
* [Create a new group](administration/groups/?id=create-a-group)
* View group details
* Click on a group to view more information and edit the group's:
  * [Users](administration/users-a/)
  * [Permission policies](administration/policies/)
* Delete a group
