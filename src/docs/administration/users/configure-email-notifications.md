## Enable Custom Email Notifications per Account

1. Open the settings menu, navigate to the Account tab and select Default Notifications Policy
2. Select the Notifications you would like to disable for all users connected to this account. This action can be done by Account Editors/Organization Admins.

The default account notification policy is available only for users who didn't define their own Notification policy. Users can define their own Notification policy using the Personal Notifications page.
