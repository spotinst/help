# vCPU

The vCPU page gives you accurate, detailed visibility into vCPU consumption across your organization. It helps you track, optimize, and manage your compute resources more effectively. This improves your cost control and operational efficiency.

In the Spot console, click the user icon <img height="18" src="https://docs.spot.io/administration/_media/usericon.png">  > **Settings** > **Usage** > **vCPU**.

In the dashboard, you can:

* View vCPU hour spending per account by spot and on-demand instance.
* Filter your spending by account, month, product, and cloud provider.
* Export your data to a CSV file.

Keep in mind:

* Data is available starting January 2025. You can view it by one month at a time, up to 12 months in the past.
* Billing is based on the amount of vCPUs being managed by the Spot platform.
* The amount of vCPUs represents the amount being charged for, and not the actual run rate.
