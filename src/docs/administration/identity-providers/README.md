# Identity Providers

You can choose from several major identity providers to manage user authentication with Spot. Identity providers create connections between cloud computing resources and users. This minimizes signing in for users when they use mobile and roaming applications.

When a relying party application consumes federated identity, it means that the application relies on an external identity provider for authentication and user identity management. Instead of managing user identities and authentication internally, the application delegates these tasks to the identity provider. This federation of identity enables seamless and secure access to the application for users from different identity providers.

An identity provider is a trusted provider that lets you use single sign-on (SSO) to access other websites. SSO enhances usability by reducing password fatigue. It also provides better security by decreasing the potential attack surface.
