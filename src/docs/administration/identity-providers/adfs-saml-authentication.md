10. Click Next and then Finish to complete the wizard.

**Configure Claim Rules**

1. A new wizard will open allowing you to configure the Claim Rules.
2. Click Next when prompted for Rule Type.
3. Enter a Name for the Claim Rule and choose Active Directory as the attribute store.
4. Enter the following Attribute Mappings:

| LDAP Attribute | Outgoing Claim |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| E-Mail-Address | Email          |
| Given-Name     | FirstName      |
| Surname        | LastName       |

5. Click Finish to complete the wizard.

## Step 2: Getting and Inserting the Metadata

1. Download your ADFS metadata xml file which is located in:
   https://<yourADFSserver>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml
2. Open the XML file for edit.
3. Locate the first <X509Certificate> tag and its closure </X509Certificate>, and change it to <ds:X509Certificate> and </ds:X509Certificate> respectively.
4. Login to your Spot account as an Admin.
5. Click on the user icon on the top right side of the screen and click Settings.

7. Click BROWSE, select your metadata file, and click SAVE.

## Step 3: Configure IDP Initiated SSP

To configure IDP Initiated SSO, additional settings must be configured as follows:

1. Login to your Spot account as an Admin.
2. Click on the user icon on the top right side of the screen and click Settings.
3. Click on the Security tab and then select Identity Providers.
4. Make a copy of the Relay State value.
5. Connect to your ADFS Server.
6. Open Powershell with administrative permissions.
7. Run the following command to enable IDP Initiated SSO:
   `Set-ADFSProperties -EnableIdPInitiatedSignonPage $true`

   - If running on Windows Server 2016, run the following command to enable Relay State:
     `Set-ADFSProperties -EnableRelayStateForIDPInitiatedSignon $true`

   - If running on Windows Server 2012R2: 1. Open the following file for edit:
     `%systemroot%\ADFS\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config` 2. Locate the line: `<microsoft.identityserver.web>` 3. Add the following line right after the <microsoft.identityserver.web> entry.
     `<useRelayStateForIdpInitiatedSignOn enabled="true" />`

8. Restart the Active Directory Federation Services Service

**IDP initiated SSO URL**

- RPID
  - This value is the relying party identifier
  - This value should be encoded
- Nested RelayState
  - This value is passed to the Relying Party as RelayState
  - This value should be encoded
- The URL query has two parts. To make things easy, [this](http://jackstromberg.com/adfs-relay-state-generator/) is a RelayState Generator which encodes and generates the URL based on the given parameters. Just insert the following:
  - IDP URL: https://<yourADFSserver>/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx
  - RP URL: https://console.spotinst.com/auth/saml
  - The Relay State that you copied in step 4

**Create a Temporary Token**

When creating a temporary token, the user credentials are validated at the IDP.

1. To create a temporary token, you provide a SAML assertion generated from your IDP. In order to get a SAML assertion from ADFS, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-saml-bearer-assertion#get-the-saml-assertion-from-adfs).
2. Run the following request. Replace '<>' with the SAML assertion response, as plain XML body (without json wrappers).

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d
'<SAML_assertion_response_XML>' https://oauth.spotinst.io/samlToken?organizationId=<organization_id>
```
