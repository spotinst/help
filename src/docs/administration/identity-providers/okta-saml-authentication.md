# Okta SAML Authentication

SSO support makes it easy to manage your accounts and works with the most popular identity providers. Let's walk through how this integration works with Okta. We borrowed the following instructions from the Okta help site to help you get started.

## Configure Okta with SAML 2.0

1. Login to your Spot account as an administrator.
2. In the console, choose Settings.
3. Click the Security tab and select Identity Providers.

6. In Okta, go to the admin panel and edit the new Spot app you just added. There, select the Sign On tab, then click Edit.
   1. Enter the Relay State value you copied earlier into the Default Relay State field.
   2. Click Save.
