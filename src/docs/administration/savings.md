# Savings

You can view how much you saved using spot instances instead of on-demand instances.

In the Spot console, click the user icon <img height="18" src="https://docs.spot.io/administration/_media/usericon.png" /> > **Settings** > **Savings**.

In the Savings page, you can:

* View costs per Spot account:
   * **Potential cost** is the price of the resource based on on-demand pricing.
   * **Actual cost** is the actual payment made to the cloud provider after Ocean/EG optimization.
   * **Savings %** is the percent of potential cost saved, calculated as (amount saved / potential cost) x 100.
   * **Amount saved** is the difference between the potential cost (on-demand pricing) and the actual cost for the selected period.
* Filter your spending by account, time, product, and resource.
* Group the rows in the list by dragging a column up to the row groups above the table.
* Click on a resource name to open that resource.
* Export your data to a CSV file.
