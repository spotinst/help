## User Details

The User Details page appears with a summary line of information about the user at the top. Below that are tabs with information about the user’s groups, policies, and API tokens.

### User Details Summary Line

The following user details are displayed:
- User Name
- Type
- Email (only for console users)
- Description (only for programmatic users)
- User ID

### Manage Groups

The Groups tab shows a listing of the groups the user belongs to. For each group, the table also shows all the policies associated with that group.

For each group, two policies are shown in the table, and the number of additional policies are indicated with a plus sign, e.g., +5 in the example below. To see a listing of the additional policies, click on the number by the plus sign.

1. Above the table on the right, click Manage.
2. In the Manage Groups popup, mark or unmark groups as needed, then click Update.

### Manage Policies

Under the Policies tab is a listing of policies associated with the user. For each policy, the table shows the policy Type and all the user’s Accounts that include the policy.

If you need to associate additional policies with the user, do the following:
1. Above the table on the right, click Manage.
2. Select the name of the policy from the dropdown list. Note that the dropdown list doesn’t include the policies the user inherited from the groups. If you wish to remove an ‘inherited’ policy, you must un-assign the user from the group or remove the policy from the group itself.
3. If the policy is at account level, you need to select at least one account to associate with this policy.

In addition, you can review existing policies and detach any policy you no longer need.

### Manage API Tokens

The API Tokens tab lists all the tokens the user has, including the last four digits of each token and the creation date.

You can [create and delete](https://docs.spot.io/administration/api/create-api-token) API tokens, depending on your permissions.

## Remove User

To remove a user from Spot, do the following:
1. In the upper right of the User Details page, click Remove User.
2. In the popup that appears, confirm that you want to remove the user from Spot.
