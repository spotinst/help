## Monthly Billing Details

The Bills page shows the monthly costs of the usage for your Spot products. It includes the payment calculation for a month and detailed breakdown of the costs for each product.

* Cost information reflects this organization only, and not all the organizations in your billing invoice.
* The report includes the usage costs only, and not the final invoice. For example, credits and discounts you may have received are not included.
* When you view data on this page, costs in the previous month appear in the charts only after the 15th of the current month. (For example, to see data that includes April, you have to view the charts on or after May 15.)
