# Multitenancy

You can use multitenancy to create hierarchies in your Spot organizations. You can set up your child orgs to use role-based access control (RBAC). Admins for your parent orgs can have admin rights for the child orgs.

Multitenancy is useful for managed service providers (MSP) and resellers. It lets you configure your child orgs at the parent level. You can then give your customers access to the child orgs.

Some of the benefits of multitenancy include:

* Simplification of complex, multi-customer structures
* Organization Admin privileges granted to parent org administrators
* Admins for the parent org can control which subaccounts and cost data types admins for the child org can see

Keep in mind, you can only create a user once for each org and all its child orgs.

An organization hierarchy includes:

* A **parent** organization (L1)

   If you have permission to view the parent org, you can see a yellow star next to the name of the parent org.

   New roles for the parent organization:

    * **Organization Admin** has access to the child organization page and <i>write</i> permissions for user management.

    * **Organization Editor** has <i>Organization Admin</i> permissions for the parent org only. Doesn’t have access to the child organization page.

* **Child** organizations (L2)

   You can see a list of all the child orgs under the parent. You can also see the number of accounts and total users for each child org.

## Remove a User from an Org

If you remove a user from an org, it doesn’t delete the user from the Spot console. If the user has permanent tokens used for APIs, those APIs will no longer work. You cannot remove a user from an org if that user is the only Organization Admin.

1. In the Spot console, click the user icon <img height="18" src="https://docs.spot.io/administration/_media/usericon.png" /> > <b>Settings</b>.
2. Go to the org you want to remove the users from.
3. Click the Total Users number to go to the Users page.
