# Organizations and Accounts

When you set up your Spot account, you create an organization and one or more account entities. You can set up multiple organizations if required. Within an organization, you can define multiple accounts for different teams or projects in the organization. Each account can be set up to use any supported cloud service provider and cloud service provider account.

## Organization

When you register to Spot, the registration wizard automatically creates an organization. The name of the organization is the company name entered in the sign up form.

The organization holds one or more Spot accounts which can be associated with your cloud service provider account. An organization helps you manage all your settings across multiple accounts in one place.

You can:

- Manage users to create, delete, and associate users with accounts
- Use API tokens to generate and delete personal and temporary tokens
- Enable and disable two-factor authentication for your Spot users
- Connect your organization to an identity provider (IDP), or use a custom SAML
- Generate billing reports for your organization
- View your Spot plan and activate your organization

- Billing information (can be separate if needed)
- Management dashboards and reports

## Account

When you register to Spot, the registration wizard automatically creates an account in your organization. The account is a child entity of your organization. You can manage multiple accounts in which each account is connected to a different cloud provider account. This allows you to manage multiple accounts and users under the same organization.

A Spot account is an equivalent to an AWS account, Azure subscription, or a GCP project.

In the account, you can:

- Connect a cloud provider account to your Spot account. This is not required. You can have an account that is not associated with a cloud provider.
- Attach existing users in your organization to the account. Users must be created at the organization level.
- Define email and Slack notifications for your organization.

## Add an Account Using the Spot Console

1. In the Spot console, click the account and click **Add Account**.
