# Organizations and Accounts

When you set up your Spot account, you create an Organization and one or more Account entities. You will most likely need only one Organization, but you can set up multiple organizations if required. Within an Organization, you can define multiple accounts for different teams or projects with the Organization. Each account can be set up to use any supported cloud provider and cloud provider account.

## Organization

When you register to Spot, the registration wizard automatically creates an Organization. An Organization holds your initial company account and is identified by name or by name and division (for example, Spot or Spot-USA).

The Organization holds one or more Spot accounts which can be associated with your cloud account. The purpose of the Organization is to help you manage in one place all of your settings across multiple accounts.

In the Organization, you can define the following:

- User Managment – Create, manage, delete, and associate users to accounts
- API Tokens – Generate and delete personal and temporary tokens
- MFA Authentication – Enable and disable two-factor authentication for your Spot users
- Identity Provider (SAML) – Connect your Organization to an IDP, or use a Custom SAML
- Billing – Generate billing reports for your Organization
- Spot Plan – View your Spot plan and activate your Organization

## Get your Organization ID

1. In the console, click on the User icon and click Settings.
2. Under the Organization tab, click General. The Organization ID is displayed.

## Linked Organizations

In case you need multiple organizations, e.g., for multiple divisions or units in your company, you can create linked organizations which can share settings and configuration such as:

- Billing Information (can be separate if needed)
- Master Dashboards and Reports

## Add an Organization

## Account

When you register to Spot, the registration wizard automatically creates an Account in your Organization. The account is a child entity of your organization. You can manage multiple accounts in which each account is connected to a different Cloud Provider Account. This allows you to manage multiple accounts and users under the same Organization.

A Spot Account is an equivalent to an AWS account.

In the Account, you can define the following:

- Cloud Provider Account – Connect your Spot account to your Cloud Provider account. (This is not mandatory. You can have an account that is not associated with a Cloud provider.)
- Attach Users – Attach existing users in your Organization to the account. Users must be created at the Organization level.
- Notifications – Define Email and Slack notifications for your Organization.
