# Permit List IP Addresses

Spot permit list IP addresses are required for integrations to work as expected. The IP must be permit-listed on the Primary nodes of Rancher, HCS, Kubernetes, Nomad, and Docker Swarm.

Ensure that your permit list IPs are always up-to-date with the latest list.

* 75.2.102.185
