# Spot API Administration

The Spot by NetApp API reference is available as an OpenAPI Specification.

OpenAPI Specification is an industry standard that allows APIs to be defined for humans as well as machines. This allows any person or application to easily consume and build with Spot in a structured format that includes detailed descriptions and examples of every endpoint. The specification is hosted on GitHub, and full documentation is available on the Spot by NetApp [API Reference](https://docs.spot.io/api/) site.
