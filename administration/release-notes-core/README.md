*  **ADM-0001 December 8, 2024:** You can use multitenancy to create hierarchies in your Spot organizations. You can set up your child orgs to use role-based access control (RBAC). Multitenancy is useful for managed service providers and resellers. It lets you configure your child orgs at the parent level. You can then give your customers access to the child orgs.
