# Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom, in-house solutions. Terraform supports many cloud providers and platforms including Spot.

It is really easy to get started with Ocean using Terraform, as it provides a simple flow to create an EKS cluster.

To get started, complete the procedures described in the [Spot Ocean Amazon EKS Terraform](https://github.com/spotinst/terraform-spotinst-ocean-eks#spotinst-ocean-amazon-eks-terraform-module) module or view the video tutorial.
