## Families 

Billing Engine provides the concept of [Families](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/families) that allows you to group together accounts and subscriptions from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for better organization of cloud billing data. Families enable the application of billing rules to accurately track chargeback and showback.  

## Strategies 

Billing Engine includes default [strategies](https://docs.spot.io/billing-engine/tutorials/strategies) for handling Reserved Instances (RI), Savings Plans, and discounts. You can create exceptions to deviate from the default billing strategy when necessary. Billing Strategies are available for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. 

## Plans

Once a plan and its associated rules are configured, they can impact the usage of targeted cloud accounts or accounts within a specific family.
