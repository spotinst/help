# Getting Started

Ocean CD provides a solution for devops engineers who ask to provide safe automations based on clear metrics and SREs who want to monitor changes to production environments in real time and investigate critical events.  

This documentation provides the enablement process Ocean CD recommends  
with the use of templates and explanations for each step.

The procedures in this section assist in installing Ocean CD’s operator into one of your clusters, create a SpotDeployment, configure the needed entities for the triggering of your progressing delivery method, and finally an explanation on how to trigger your rollouts.
