# Spot Storage for AWS

Spot Storage is a managed service that optimizes cloud storage using capacity and performance auto-scaling engines and waste management technology for object, block, and file storage.

Based on historical usage and modeling of future application storage needs, Spot Storage removes wasted, unused storage and optimizes the underlying storage type, disk size, and filesystem to achieve maximum performance and efficiency at the lowest cost.

Spot Storage is available to you (AWS users) with immediate, actionable insights to reduce costs and improve efficiency for storage.

## Put Storage Optimization on Autopilot

DevOps teams continually tune cloud infrastructure to meet application SLOs.  Storage is a key part of this equation to balance application speed and overall costs. Tuning storage is usually a manual and tedious process often left to optimize only after compute needs are handled first. Tuning throughput, IOPS, and capacity is some of the most time-consuming and sensitive work that most infrastructure teams face.

With Spot Storage, DevOps teams now have a simple and reliable way to optimize storage without needing to spend time on manual research, configuration, and monitoring.  Spot Storage enables your teams to adapt quickly to changing application needs and new storage types.

## Reduce Costs – What You Can do Now

You can use the Spot Storage dashboard directly in the Spot console to view cost optimization recommendations for your managed storage resources. The dashboard covers all storage components across your AWS account and generates real-time actions you can take to address wasted or misconfigured resources. Implementing those suggestions provides high potential cost savings that you can act on immediately.

To achieve a simplified management experience, the dashboard aggregates the storage resources by their type and physical location, summarizes the calls to action (including the affected volume details), and calculates the potential monthly savings for each recommendation and in total.

Spot’s analysis of your cloud provides several types of recommendations regarding the use of EBS volumes and file systems. We recommend that you click on all the recommended actions, review the affected objects, and take the appropriate actions.

From the dashboard, you can see lists of specific items to remove or modify, mark your choices, and take action immediately.
