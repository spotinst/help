# Inventory Reports 

Cost Intelligence provides detailed inventory reports for a variety of services for both AWS and Azure cloud services. These reports let you view your entire infrastructure by service. With the snapshot feature (history), you can view snapshots by service by day. **History** defaults to the last successful snapshot. You can select a different date to view the snapshots.

In the inventory reports, you can:
* Click **Export** to get your data in a CSV file.
* Click <img height="18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27076063-7a46-424b-a4d3-5ee82bfe6d80" /> to show the list of columns for the cloud service.
* You can sort by columns, resize the columns, and reorder them by dragging them around the table.
